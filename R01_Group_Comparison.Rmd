-   R Basics: Install and load a package. Load a Stata files into R.
-   Data Manipulation: `tidyverse` language (glimpse, count, filter, summarise).
-   Data Visualization: Grouped boxplots, advanced programming pictograms.
-   How to find information on the web via Google.

:::

Groups can be compared via numeric figure or graphical instruments. Numeric summaries can be the mean, median or mode. A graphical representation can be a boxplot, histogram or density curve. Note that certain calculations and visualizations only make sense for continuous variables (cf. scale of measurements).

## Understanding Data

### Loading the Data

Go to <https://www.diw.de/en/diw_01.c.603154.en/soep_in_the_college_classroom.html> and download the Stata file `soep_lebensz_en.dta`. Put this file in the same directory as your R script or markdown and load data as follows (no path):

```{r}
# load package 
library(haven)
# load data
#soep <- read_dta("soep_lebensz_en.dta")

library(haven)
temp <- tempfile()
download.file("https://www.diw.de/documents/dokumentenarchiv/17/diw_01.c.412698.de/soep_lebensz_en.zip",temp)
soep <- read_dta(unz(temp, "soep_lebensz_en.dta"))
unlink(temp)
```

If data is somewhere else, you need to specify the exact path (relative or absolute path) to the data. If you use `haven` (or any other package) for the first time, you have to install (e.g. via a command `install.packages("haven")`). You can also install and check packages in the right lower panel (cf. "packages").

### Inspect the Data

The SOEP practice dataset consists of a total of 9 original variables and 12,922 measurements. We can see 9 variables as columns with the `glimpse()` function. The first two variable *(id, year) are identifier*. The panel data is in *long format, i.e. every row is a person-year combination*. It covers five time points. The last two variables are standardized versions (satisfaction and health). Actually we have 5 variables to analyze.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
glimpse(soep)
```

First, let's check the consecutive time points. The `count()` function provides the number of occurrences for values of a variables.

```{r}
soep %>%
  count(year)
```

We observe a decline in observations over time. People drop out of the survey for various reasons (**panel attrition**). SOEP regularly adds refreshment samples to compensate for this. Sometimes we miss data in between years. Person number 457 participated in 2000, 2002 and 2004:

```{r}
soep %>%
  filter(id == 457)
```

Person 457 was not available in the year 2001 for some reason.

### Summary statistics

Now let's have a look at **summary statistics** for the dataset. The `stargazer` package (with `type="text"`) displays number of observations, mean, standard deviation, min, max and percentiles to the console or markdown file (it produces a .tex table by default). `stargazer` requires a dataframe as input. `haven` created a tibble from the Stata .dta file. Finally, we select all variables but the first two, since they are identifier and any calculation, e.g. the mean of personal IDs, does not make much sense here.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(stargazer)
stargazer(as.data.frame(soep)[,(3:9)], type="text")
```

The mean of `sex` is 0.539. What does it tell you?

### Missing data

Check out the first `glimpse()` table. Have you noticed the value `NA` in `education`? **NA** stand for non available and is the indicator for **missing data in R**. We ask for a table count of all values in the data that are either missing or not missing.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
table(is.na(soep))
```

One option is substituting values (e.g. the mean) for missing cells (**imputation**). The alternative, for simplicitiy, is removing all rows which contain a missing value in any column. This is called a **complete case analysis**.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
soep_no_na <- soep %>% filter(complete.cases(.))
```

### Standardization

Look again at the `glimpse()` output or `stargazer()` table. Notice two versions of satisfaction and health, i.e. `satisf_org` and `satisf_std` which represent satisfaction on the original scale (from 0 to 10) and a *standardized* version of satisfaction. Health is ranging from 1 to 5. How can we compare the mean of satisfaction and health?

In statistics, **standardization** is the process of putting different variables on the same scale. This process allows you to compare scores between different types of variables (compare apples with apples instead of apples with bananas). Typically, to standardize variables, you calculate the mean and standard deviation for a variable (cf. z-score). Then, for each observed value of the variable, you subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation.

Consequently, standardized variables have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

```{r}
soep_no_na %>%
  summarise(across(c(satisf_std, health_std), list(mean, sd))) %>%
  `colnames<-`(c("mean of std. satis", "sd of std. satis", 
                 "mean of std. health", "sd of std. health"))
```

Here `summarise` is asked to apply the `mean()` and `sd()` function "across" the two columns `satisf_std` and `health_std`. The means are close to zero and the standard deviation is close to one. The minor differences result from our complete case analysis (we already dropped some cases which might have been used for the initial standardization).

<!-- Now let's quickly redo this kind of standardization. There are built-in functions such as `scale()`, this should produce a more accurate mean and standard deviation.  -->

<!-- # ```{r} -->

<!-- # mean(scale(soep_no_na$satisf_std)) -->

<!-- # sd(scale(soep_no_na$satisf_std)) -->

<!-- # ``` -->

<!-- Let's do it by hand.  -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- soep_no_na %>% -->

<!--   mutate(satisf_std_2 = (satisf_org - mean(satisf_org))/sd(satisf_org), -->

<!--          health_std_2 = (health_org - mean(health_org))/sd(health_org)) %>% -->

<!--   dplyr::select(satisf_std, satisf_std_2, health_std, health_std_2) %>% -->

<!--   head(n=5) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- soep_no_na %>% -->

<!--   ggplot(aes(x=satisf_std, color=health_std, fill=health_std)) +  -->

<!--   geom_density() -->

<!-- df <- gather(soep_no_na, key = 'Std_Variable', value = 'Value', contains('std')) -->

<!-- ggplot(df, aes(x = Value, group = Std_Variable, fill = Std_Variable, color = Std_Variable)) +  -->

<!--   geom_density(alpha = 0.3) -->

<!-- ``` -->

## Analysis (10 pt)

Now, it's your turn to find and implement R code in order to achieve the following tasks.

### Subsample (2 pt)

Create a subsample of people with no children in the household (subsetting). This should be $n=7428$ observations. Call it `nokids`.

```{r,  results='asis', echo=F}
cat(
  '<pre class="r">
  <code class = "hlsj"> <span class="hljs-string"> <br> <br> </span> </code>
  </pre>
  ')
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# BASE R (keeps NA)
nokids <- soep[soep$no_kids==0,]               # select columns
nokids <- nokids[!is.na(nokids$no_kids),]      # remove NA

# subset command (removes NA automatically)
nokids2 <- subset(soep, no_kids == 0)

# using dplyr pipe logic
nokids3 <- soep %>%
  filter(no_kids == 0)
```

### Mean per group (2 pt)

Please calculate the mean of education for men and women and store the means into one or two objects (dependent on how you calculate it). You may use base R or tidyverse functions.

```{r,  results='asis', echo=F}
cat(
  '<pre class="r">
  <code class = "hlsj"> <span class="hljs-string"> <br> <br> </span> </code>
  </pre>
  ')
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# TAPPLY
nokids <- nokids[!is.na(nokids$education),]                     # remove NA in education first
means1 <- tapply(nokids$education, INDEX=nokids$sex, FUN=mean)  # 11.87030 and  11.66355 

# AGGREGATE (e.g. Ekaterina)
means2 <- aggregate(education~sex, nokids, mean)                # 11.87030 and 11.66355

# BY (e.g. Ornela)
means3 <- by(nokids$education, nokids$sex, mean, na.rm=TRUE)

# DPLYR pipe (e.g. Elena) 
means_m <- nokids %>% na.omit() %>% 
  filter(sex==0) %>% summarize(mean_education=mean(education))  # 11.86989
means_f <- nokids %>% na.omit() %>% 
  filter(sex==1) %>% summarize(mean_education=mean(education))  # 11.66308

# DPLYR pipe (e.g. Cecilia)
means4 <- nokids %>% group_by(sex)%>% summarize(means = mean(education, na.rm=TRUE))

# Tick label before (e.g. by Egor / Oshin)
nokids$sex2 <- factor(nokids$sex, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("Male", "Female"))
```

### Grouped Boxplot (4 pt)

Create a boxplot of years of education grouped by gender (fe/male). A **boxplot** is a method for graphically depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles. It shows 50 % of the data in a box and the median in the middle of the box and whiskers outsider of the box.

```{r,  results='asis', echo=F}
cat(
  '<pre class="r">
  <code class = "hlsj"> <span class="hljs-string"> <br> <br> </span> </code>
  </pre>
  ')
```

Replicate the following figure. You can either do this with base R or `ggplot`. The labels (title, subtitle, axis) should be identical. Furthermore, add the mean of the groups to the boxplot (as red bold point or something similar).

```{r echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
###----------------------
### BASE R 
###----------------------

## png("my_boxplot_0123456.png", width = 500, height = 400)        # graph environment saves file to directory 
boxplot(education ~ sex, data=nokids, xlab="", col = "lightgray",
        ylab="Years of Education", main="Boxplot of Education",
        sub="Subsample of People with no children in household",
        names=c("Men","Women"))                                     # Tick label afterwards 

points(means1,col="red",pch=18,lwd=2, cex=2)
## dev.off()

boxplot(education ~ sex2, data=nokids, xlab="", col = "lightgray",
        ylab="Years of Education", main="Boxplot of Education",
        sub="Subsample of People with no children in household")                                     

# Tick labels by the axis function (by Veronika)
boxplot(education ~ sex, data=nokids, xlab="", col = "lightgray",
        ylab="Years of Education", main="Boxplot of Education",
        sub="Subsample of People with no children in household", axes=FALSE) # delete all axes
box()                                                                        # rebuild it from cratch
axis(side = 1, at = c(1:2), labels=c("Men", "Women"))
axis(side = 2)
```

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '80%'}
###----------------------
### GGplot2 (by Egor, modified by Marco) 
###----------------------

# when sex is a factor variable
ggplot(nokids, aes(x = sex2, y = education)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Education", 
       x = "Subsample of People with no child in household", 
       y = "Years of Education") + 
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", size = 3, color = "red")
  #stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", size = 3, color = "red", shape=21, fill="red")
```

The two boxplots look very similar. In both groups the mean is higher than the median. This is an indication that the distribution of education is **skewed** to the right.

Is `education` a continuous variable? Not really. Actually, students usually graduate after 10 or 12 years of education in Germany.

```{r echo = TRUE}
table(soep_no_na$education)
```

<!-- - The p-value of 3.321e-05 (scientific notation) -->

<!-- - The 95% confidence interval is [0.1057920;0.2950069] -->

<!-- ### Panel data -->

<!-- It is easy to get a cross-section by filtering for a given year. We can be sure that every individual (id) is only included once. But perhaps someone is was not asked or was not part of the survey in this year, but in several other so called waves. Why don't we use his or her data as well?

## Advanced Graphics (4 pt bonus)

<!-- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48522350/create-an-image-filled-chart-in-r-using-ggplot -->

Remember Figure 1 where we easily compared two percentage numbers filled proportionally in pictograms of men and women? How could we possibly do something like that in R? The purpose of this challenge is to train your skills in searching the internet for similar solutions and adapting code for your own needs.

If you google something like ["How to create a grouped boxplot in r"](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=How+to+create+a+grouped+boxplot+in+r) or ["How to create an image filled with percentage in r"](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=How+to+create+an+image+filled+with+percentage+in+r) the chances are extremely high that first, someone else had the same problem and second, **stackoverflow** will be one of the top google hits. SO is a famous question and answer site for professional and enthusiast programmers and statisticians.

Your challenge:

-   Find a gender difference that you are interested in and would like to share.
-   Remember the source. Cite the source in the figure caption.
-   Look up and modify (long and complicated) code, e.g. from stackoverflow.
-   In the given ggplot `theme_void` is used to remove axes and background, the legend is removed by `legend.position = "none"` and labels are annotated manually via `annotate`.
