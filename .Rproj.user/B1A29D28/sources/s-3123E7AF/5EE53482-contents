What is academic writing, why is it important and so difficult? How much work should I put into the writeup? **A lot**.

When you have your first full version of the report, then you probably got about 50% of the work done! -- *Andrea Ichino*

## First Impression

::: {.infobox2 .information data-latex="warning"}
There is no second chance for a first impression.
:::

Often the first think people see about your work is the **title**, **introduction** and perhaps a *killer graph*. 

- First goal: **Impress** (as a person + with your work)
- Second goal: **Define your contribution** (this might be subtle) 
- Third goal: Make your work known (publish)

If you are uncertain about anything, people think you are also uncertain about your work.

### The Title

Think about it: This is how people will remember your work – or not. 

Make it interesting! Give Keywords. What are the strength of your work (new data, new methods, new question)? 

<!-- Example: „ICT and education: Evidence from Student Home Addresses“ -->
<!-- No mention of „England“ -->
<!-- „ICT“ very general, paper is „only“ about broadband availability (you get told in abstract) -->
<!-- „Student Home Addresses“ –detailed (admin) data!  -->

All words in the title are to be capitalized except definite and indefinite articles, prepositions of all kind and coordinating conjunctions.

<!-- *German Foreign Direct Investment in Poland: An Investigation into the Regionalisation Pattern and the Role of Special Economic Zones.* -->

> The Relationship Between Relative Income & Happiness: An Empirical Analysis Utilising GSOEP Panel Data And Fixed-Effects Models

### The Introduction
<!-- Referees decide on your paper after reading the intro –if not long before! -->

Put everything in there!

You find a lot of useful hints on the web:

- <https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/write-stronger-introductions>

But I would like to shift your focus to this particular one:

<https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/telling-a-story.html> 

Most data visualization (or analysis) is done for the purpose of communication. We have an insight about a dataset, and we have a potential audience, and we would like to convey our insight to our audience. [...]

To communicate our insight successfully, we will have to present the audience with a clear and exciting story. [...]

Your goal in telling a story should be to use facts and logical reasoning to get your audience interested and excited. [...]

To tell a complete story, we will usually need multiple visualizations. For example, when giving a presentation, we may first show some background or motivational material, then a figure that creates a challenge, and eventually some other figure that provides the resolution.

It is, however, also possible to condense an entire story arc into a single figure. Such a figure must contain a challenge and a resolution at the same time, and it is comparable to a story arc that starts with a lead.

## R Markdown 

### Block quotes

> „Use block quotes parsimoniously. “

### BibTeX

Source: <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/bibliography.html>

- Create an empty text document in the directory of your markdown document, name it `references`. 
- It will probably  automatically be created as `references.txt`. You can change the file type by simply renaming the file extension into `references.bib`. [Here is how you do this on Windows](https://helpdesk.flexradio.com/hc/en-us/articles/204676189-How-to-change-a-File-Extension-in-Windows)
- In this text/bib file you can store a resource as this:

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.cap="A BibTeX Entry in a Text File.", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("bibtex-entry.png")
```

Items can be cited directly within the documentation using the syntax `@key` where key is the citation key in the first line of the entry, e.g., `@R-base` which turns into @R-base. To put citations in parentheses, use `[@key]`. To cite multiple entries, separate the keys by semicolons, e.g., `[@key-1; @key-2; @key-3]`. To suppress the mention of the author, add a minus sign before @, e.g., `[-@R-base]`.

Why do we get the information from? Use Google Scholar 

<https://scholar.google.de/scholar?hl=de&q=Stutzer%20and%20Frey%20(2008)&lr=>

```{r , echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.cap="Google Scholar Search.", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("gs.png")
```

<!-- @article{stutzer2008stress, -->
<!--   title={Stress that doesn't pay: The commuting paradox}, -->
<!--   author={Stutzer, Alois and Frey, Bruno S}, -->
<!--   journal={Scandinavian Journal of Economics}, -->
<!--   volume={110}, -->
<!--   number={2}, -->
<!--   pages={339--366}, -->
<!--   year={2008}, -->
<!--   publisher={Wiley Online Library} -->
<!-- } -->

**Attention**: Google Scholar is very reliable but not perfect. At the end, you need to invest time to check all your bibtex resources and fix potential problems.
