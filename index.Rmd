# Background 

A dusty lecture hall. The light cut through the darkness from the left side of the room. A creaky, slow and loyal laptop in front of me. That's where R was introduced in my psychology undergraduate studies. A bearish but competent assistant professor explained how to analyze and evaluate the results of various memory and cognition experiments through boxplots, t-test and the like in R.
