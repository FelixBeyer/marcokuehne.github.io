# Dust and Dark {-}

A dusty lecture hall. The light cut through the darkness from the left side of the room. A dozen of seats in each bench, only few occupied by small groups of students who were trying to make sure that they sit far from each other and as far as possible from the lecturer. The bearish but competent assistant professor explained how to analyze and evaluate the results of various memory and cognition experiments through boxplots, t-test and the like in that software. My creaky, slow but loyal laptop in front of me. That's where R was introduced in my psychology undergraduate studies.

-   Conceptual Skills: What makes a good comparison. Never use pie charts. 
-   Data Skills: 
    +   R Basics: Install and load a package. Load Stata files into R.
    +   Data Manipulation: `tidyverse` language (`glimpse()`, `count()`, `filter()`, `summarise()`).
    +   Data Visualization: Pie chart and bar plot.
