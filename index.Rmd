# Dust and Dark {-}

A dusty lecture hall. The light cut through the darkness from the left side of the room. A dozen of seats in each bench, only few occupied by small groups of students who were trying to make sure that they sit far from each other and as far as possible from the lecturer. The bearish but competent assistant professor explained how to analyze and evaluate the results of various memory and cognition experiments through boxplots, t-test and the like in that software. My creaky, slow but loyal laptop in front of me. That's where R was introduced in my psychology undergraduate studies.

# (PART) Preface {-} 

# Teach -- Learn -- Repeat {-}

<!-- Conceptional Background -->
<!-- A Question You Care About -->
<!-- subtitle: "A Kickstart for Social Scientists" -->
<!-- In order to pass a math class, become the head of a study group.  -->
<!-- Humans feel positive emotion when they have social ties. -->

Teaching and learning are strongly connected. I fell in love with [learning by teaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching) the moment I came across this concept. It put the experiences I made into scientific context. Studying for the undergraduate math classes, I soon became head of the study group, than a private tutor, than a student assistant and a doctoral student, now, teaching stuff for over a decade. Still, I feel that (trying) to teach stuff is the best way of learning it myself.

<!-- I had to pass math classes in my undergraduates, and I became a math tutor for years. I really wanted to master ballroom dance, so I became a dance instructor for life.  -->

<!-- The mode of teaching can differ. I started teaching in the classroom and ballroom and have a standing on Wikipedia. You can contribute on Wikipedia and will get feedback on your neutral point of view, academic writing and rigor. Feedback on YouTube and Social Media can be more diffuse. Now, I turn to writing a book from my collected notes (and questions) on empirical research.  -->

By writing the gitbook I hope to force myself to pinpoint exactly what I know and don't know about data and how to fill the gaps. Luckily, I am not alone with the approach of creating classes or writing books to learn:

> I could feel that econometrics was indispensable, and yet I was missing something. But what? It was a theory of causality […]. <b>So, desperate, I did what I always do when I want to learn something new — I developed a course on causality to force myself to learn all the things I didn’t know.</b>
>
> `r tufte::quote_footer('Scott Cunningham. In: Causal Inference – The Mixtape')`

This project helped me to learn more about R, RStudio, R Markdown, R Bookdown, HTML/CSS, Git and Github, empirical research, causal inference, statistics, math, frustration tolerance and fun.

<!-- I had the need to learn more about empirical analysis and causal inference. Thus I started a series of seminars covering a mixture of data science, econometrics, statistics and reporting.  -->

**Aim of this book.** I welcome you to join me on the way to become fluent in data.

We hope this book will be a useful introduction for anyone who wants to learn how to use R. It started out as a 100 page pdf manual used to support our teaching in numerous undergraduate and postgraduate biostatistics classes at the University of Aberdeen and has evolved over the last 10 years to the book you’re now reading. Consequently, this book is primarily written with the advanced undergraduate or postgraduate student in mind although the material should be useful for anyone with an interest in learning R regardless of background. Our book assumes that you have no previous experience of using either R or RStudio and no background in programming or using command-line driven software. We’ve also tried to make the content of this book operating system agnostic and have included information for Windows, Mac and Linux users where appropriate.

# About the author {-}

Welcome! My name is Marco Kühne (<http://marco-kuehne.com/>). The very first thing I want to do is to invite you to call me Marco. That is, if we meet on the street, you come talk to me during office hours, you ask some question; Marco’s the name that I respond to.

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the European University Viadrina (<https://www.wiwi.europa-uni.de/>). I am generally keen on teaching topics related to research design, quantitative methods, and statistical software. My main methodological interests in quantitative social science include panel data modelling, causal inference with observational data and R programming.

I am also a gardening fanatic, a coffee enthusiast, an engaged ballroom dancer, a (vegetarian) food lover. I enjoy cutting down big trees and practicing new languages in its own sake. Feel free to contact me!
