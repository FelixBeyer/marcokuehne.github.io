# A Question You Care About

Are you passionate about something? Research starts off from a question you really care about. Math, statistics and programming are easier to digest when you are intrinsically motivated to find out more about your topic of interest. This is a brief guide on the main parts of the empirical research process. There's more to the end of it. After answering the research question, a theoretical interpretation can be derived, results are compared to earlier research and conclusions are drawn. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(DiagrammeR)

grViz(diagram = "digraph flowchart {
  node [fontname = arial, shape = oval, color = grey, style = filled]
  tab1 [label = '@@1']
  tab2 [label = '@@2']
  tab3 [label = '@@3']
  tab4 [label = '@@4']
  tab5 [label = '@@5']
  
  tab1 -> tab2 -> tab3 -> tab4 -> tab5 -> tab1;
}

<!-- how to do it yourself instead of relying on data and analysis from someone else. -->

<!-- The chances are pretty high that there is data on your subject.  -->

<!-- A good research question is essential to guide your research paper or thesis. It pinpoints exactly what you want to find out and gives your work a clear focus and purpose. All research questions should be focused, specific and relevant. An empirical research question can be answered by collecting and analyzing data. -->
