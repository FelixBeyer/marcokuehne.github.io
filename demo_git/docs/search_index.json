This template shows how instructors can easily create lightweight, interactive web documents that students can use in self-guided learning. The {webexercises} package provides a number of functions that you use in inline R code to create HTML widgets (text boxes, pull down menus, buttons that reveal hidden content). Examples are given next. Render the book to see how they work. NOTE: To use the widgets in the compiled HTML files, you need to have a JavaScript-enabled browser. 0.1 Example Questions These functions are optimised to be used with inline r code, but you can also use them in code chunks by setting the chunk option results = 'asis' and using cat() to display the result of the widget. # echo = FALSE, results = &#39;asis&#39; opts &lt;- c(&quot;install.package&quot;, &quot;install.packages&quot;, answer = &quot;library&quot;, &quot;libraries&quot;) q1 &lt;- mcq(opts) cat(&quot;What function loads a package that is already on your computer?&quot;, q1) What function loads a package that is already on your computer? install.packageinstall.packageslibrarylibraries 0.1.1 Total Correct (total_correct()) The function total_correct() displays a running total of correct responses. Change the elem argument to display in a different style (e.g., h2 or h3 for header styles). If you're comfortable with css styles or classes, you can add them with the args argument. 0.1.2 Fill-In-The-Blanks (fitb()) Create fill-in-the-blank questions using fitb(), providing the answer as the first argument. 2 + 2 is You can also create these questions dynamically, using variables from your R session. The square root of 16 is: The blanks are case-sensitive; if you don't care about case, use the argument ignore_case = TRUE. What is the letter after D? If you want to ignore differences in whitespace use, use the argument ignore_ws = TRUE (which is the default) and include spaces in your answer anywhere they could be acceptable. How do you load the tidyverse package? You can set more than one possible correct answer by setting the answers as a vector. Type a vowel: You can use regular expressions to test answers against more complex rules. Type any 3 letters: 0.1.3 Multiple Choice (mcq()) \"Never gonna give you up, never gonna: let you goturn you downrun awaylet you down\" \"I bless the rainsguess it rainssense the rain down in Africa\" -Toto 0.1.4 True or False (torf()) True or False? You can permute values in a vector using sample(). TRUEFALSE 0.1.5 Longer MCQs (longmcq()) When your answers are very long, sometimes a drop-down select box gets formatted oddly. You can use longmcq() to deal with this. Since the answers are long, It's probably best to set up the options inside an R chunk with echo=FALSE. What is a p-value? the probability that the null hypothesis is true the probability of the observed, or more extreme, data, under the assumption that the null-hypothesis is true the probability of making an error in your conclusion What is true about a 95% confidence interval of the mean? 95% of the data fall within this range if you repeated the process many times, 95% of intervals calculated in this way contain the true mean there is a 95% probability that the true mean lies within this range 0.2 Hidden solutions and hints You can fence off a solution area that will be hidden behind a button using hide() before the solution and unhide() after, each as inline R code. Pass the text you want to appear on the button to the hide() function. If the solution is an RMarkdown code chunk, instead of using hide() and unhide(), simply set the webex.hide chunk option to TRUE, or set it to the string you wish to display on the button. 0.2.0.1 Example problem Recreate the scatterplot below, using the built-in cars dataset. I need a hint See the documentation for plot() (?plot) Click here to see the solution plot(cars$speed, cars$dist) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed). You may want to try searching to find the page's new location, or use the table of contents to find the page you are looking for. "]]
