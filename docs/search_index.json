There is a dramatic change in the number of babies per woman in the last 50 years. The maintenance of a stable human population requires that the mean number of children women should have by the completion of the fertile part of their life is 2.1.1 We cannot know this without measurement. We may have an impression that families are smaller, but that could just be the people we know directly – and most of us know directly at most a couple of hundred households.2 We have to measure to know the big picture and we have to keep measuring to see how the picture is changing. Size matters. Change matters. Without measurement we can describe neither current condition nor the history of current condition. 1.1.2 Global surface temperature is rising. Figure 1.1: Global temperature in the common era. Source: Wikipedia The 2011–2020 decade warmed to an average 1.09 °C [0.95–1.20 °C] compared to the pre-industrial baseline (1850–1900). Figure 1.1 shows a global surface temperature reconstruction over the last 2000 years using proxy data from tree rings, corals, and ice cores in blue. Directly observed data is in red (Wikipedia contributors 2022). Data is required to make informed decisions. Decisions about climate change are complex, costly and have long-term implications. It is therefore vital that such decisions are based on the best available evidence. We need to understand the quality and provenance of that evidence, and whether any assumptions have been made in generating it. 1.2 How we measure Data collection is the process of gathering and measuring information. As social scientists we rarely count tree rings or analyse corals and ice cores. In social science, common data collection methods are: Surveys (paper vs. online) Interviews Observation Experiment (mainly conducted by psychologists) Focus group (qualitative research) Case study (qualitative research) Primary data refers to the first hand data gathered by the researcher or practitioner himself. Secondary data means data collected by someone else. As you expect, it can be more complicated, cost and time expensive to collect data yourself. A lot of data can be found at various institutions (e.g. statistical offices). Sometimes data can be freely downloaded from web sources. Sometimes a registration is required. Some data is available for research but not for commercial purposes. Data Scraping is the transfer of information from a source like a website to a database. 1.3 Types of data The following distinctions of data are important to this course. Quantitative data deals with things that are measurable and can be expressed in numbers or figures, or using other values that express quantity. That being said, quantitative data is usually expressed in numerical form and can represent size, length, duration, amount, price, and so on. Qualitative data is often non-numeric. Data can be text, audio or visual. There are quantitative approaches to analyse text (text mining, e.g. sentiment analysis) and visual data (machine learning, e.g. image classification). Sometimes quantitative data is understood as metric continuous as opposed to qualitative data in the form of categorical data. Cross-sectional data is measured at a point in time (e.g. one year). Longitudinal data or panel data is repeated measures over time (e.g. multiple years). 1.4 The reality behind the data ... it is important not to lose sight of the individuals whose lives provide the data for the models. Although variables rather than individual people may become the subjects of the statistician’s narrative, it is individuals rather than variables who have the capacity to act and reflect on society. Elliott, 1999. In: Byrne (2002) The Encyclopaedia of Statistical Sciences (1999) describes variables as manifest or observed when they are directly measurable or hidden or latent as \"idealized constructs at best only indirectly measurable\". Remember Figure 1.1 that shows a global surface temperature reconstruction using proxy data from tree rings, corals, and ice cores in blue and directly observed data in red. Some concepts are easy to grasp and there is a broad consensus on how to measure them. Age is indisputable measured in years. Number of Twitter follower at a given time. Temperature can be measured in Celsius or Fahrenheit (SI units). There is an accepted translation between the Celsius and Fahrenheit, i.e. 0°C correspond to 32°F and 0°F correspond to -17.8°C. Some concepts are harder to grasp and require a specific argument. Intelligence. What is it and how can we measure it? Populism. What is it and how can we measure it? Happiness. What is it and how can we measure it? We may ask the questions: What is the effect of age on Twitter usage? What is the effect of intelligence on happiness? In order to conduct an empirical analysis, all concepts need to be variables (columns in rectangular data). It's likely that there will be a variable age and follower as well as intelligence and happiness. There are common or popular believes on what happiness is. But there is no universal accepted measure. Definition Operationalization means turning abstract concepts into measurable observations. It involves clearly defining your variables and indicators.3 One might apply the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (version IV, released 2008) to measure intelligence. Scores from intelligence tests are estimates of intelligence. Unlike, for example, distance and mass, a concrete measure of intelligence cannot be achieved given the abstract nature of the concept of \"intelligence\". Variables of a dataset are often accompanied by a detailed explanation of called a codebook. Definition A codebook describes the contents, structure, and layout of a data collection. Your Turn Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) is a household panel study and a department at DIW Berlin. Look up the codebook of pequiv dataset https://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.704530.de/diw_ssp0772.pdf What is the variable P11101? (Hint, use a single word) What is the variable M11122? (Hint, use a single word) What is the minimum age for E11101 (Annual Work Hours of Individual) to be reported? (Hint, use a single number) 1.5 Data sets Here are some examples of high quality data sources that are useful in social science.
