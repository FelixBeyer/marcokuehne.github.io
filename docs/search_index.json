A dozen of seats in each bench, only few occupied by small groups of students who were trying to make sure that they sit far from each other and as far as possible from the lecturer. The bearish but competent assistant professor explained how to analyze and evaluate the results of various memory and cognition experiments through boxplots, t-test and the like in that software.

"],["about-the-author.html", "About the author Teach – Learn – Repeat", " About the author   Welcome! My name is Marco Kühne. The very first thing I want to do is to invite you to call me Marco. That is, if we meet on the street, you come talk to me during office hours, you ask some question; Marco’s the name that I respond to. Web: http://marco-kuehne.com/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/marco_kuhne GitHub: https://github.com/MarcoKuehne I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the European University Viadrina (https://www.wiwi.europa-uni.de/). I am generally keen on teaching topics related to research design, quantitative methods, and statistical software. My main methodological interests in quantitative social science include panel data modelling, causal inference with observational data and R programming. I am also a gardening fanatic, a coffee enthusiast, a committed ballroom and Discofox dancer, a (vegetarian) food lover. I enjoy cutting down big trees and practicing new languages in its own sake. Feel free to contact me! Teach – Learn – Repeat Teaching and learning are strongly connected. I fell in love with learning by teaching the moment I came across this concept. It put the experiences I made into scientific context. Studying for the undergraduate math classes, I soon became head of the study group, than a private tutor, than a student assistant and a doctoral student, now, teaching stuff for over a decade. Still, I feel that (trying) to teach stuff is the best way of learning it myself. By writing the gitbook I hope to force myself to pinpoint exactly what I know and don't know about data and how to fill the gaps. Luckily, I am not alone with the approach of creating classes or writing books to learn: I could feel that econometrics was indispensable, and yet I was missing something. But what? It was a theory of causality […]. So, desperate, I did what I always do when I want to learn something new — I developed a course on causality to force myself to learn all the things I didn’t know. Cunningham (2021) This project helped me to learn more about R, RStudio, R Markdown, R Bookdown, HTML/CSS, Git and Github, empirical research, causal inference, statistics, math, frustration tolerance and fun. Teaching in 2014. Learning by teaching was originally defined by Jimmy WalesLinus TorvaldsJean-Pol MartinRichard E. Pattis in the 1980s.

Aims of this book You go from zero you hero in data analysis and data science and will become data fluent and learn major skills that you can use in your academic and business career. The ability to take data — to be able to understand it, to process it, to extract value from it, to visualize it, to communicate it — that’s going to be a hugely important skill in the next decades... Hal Varian, 2009. Googles chief economist. In: McKinsey Quarterly 2009 In addition and independent of a specific career, I would like to foster people's data literacy. Definition Data literacy is the ability to read, understand, create, and communicate data as information. I would like to enable and empower all people to understand the data work of others. Don't take numbers for granted. It's a long journey to get them. Don't be satisfied with a summary or conclusion from someone else. It's worthwhile checking data sources and data work. Either to replicate and validate the data work of others or to form your own opinion. Not to mention, coding is fun. You might be under the impression, to code, your favorite thing must be computers. Or I've heard I'm bad a math, I can't code. None of this is true. Think about it, what is your passion. Learn to code, is something that you can do. And something that may just expand the way you approach and think about the passions in your life. Be their personal or professional.   A wordcloud of 25 students answers (2020) on the question: What do you expect to learn in this seminar? The animation is created by the gifski package. Structure Every chapters covers the content of a week. The first half of the course (chapter 1 -- 7) introduces all the basics from scratch. We measure and collect data to make informed decisions. Most decisions are complex, costly and have long-term implications. It is therefore vital that such decisions are based on the best available evidence. The second half of the course (chapter 8 -- 13) focuses on the analysis of relationships. It opens the realm of research questions and projects. We try to answer apparently simple but intriguing questions from daily life. For example: Can money buy happiness? Does watching TV make us happy? What are the economic consequences of being left-handed? How does beauty affect your income? The workhorse procedure is regression, a statistical technique that relates a outcome variable to one or more explanatory variables.
