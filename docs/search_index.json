The light cut through the darkness from the left side of the room. A dozen of seats in each bench, only few occupied by small groups of students who were trying to make sure that they sit far from each other and as far as possible from the lecturer. The bearish but competent assistant professor explained how to analyze and evaluate the results of various memory and cognition experiments through boxplots, t-test and the like in that software. My creaky, slow but loyal laptop in front of me. Thats where R was introduced in my psychology undergraduate studies. Teach  Learn  Repeat I fell in love with learning by teaching the moment I came across this concept. It put the experiences I made into scientific context. I had to pass math classes in my undergraduates, and I became a math tutor for years. I really wanted to master ballroom dance, so I became a dance instructor for life. The mode of teaching can differ. I started teaching in the classroom and ballroom and have a standing on Wikipedia. You can contribute on Wikipedia and will get feedback on your neutral point of view, academic writing and rigor. Feedback on YouTube and Social Media can be more diffuse. Now, I turn to writing a book from my collected notes (and questions) on empirical research. I hope to force myself to pinpoint exactly what I know and dont know and how to fill the gaps. Luckily, I am not alone with the approach of creating classes or writing books to learn. I could feel that econometrics was indispensable, and yet I was missing something. But what? It was a theory of causality []. So, desperate, I did what I always do when I want to learn something new  I developed a course on causality to force myself to learn all the things I didnt know.

In: Causal Inference  The Mixtape This project helped me to learn more about R, RStudio, R Markdown, R Bookdown, HTML/CSS, Git and Github, empirical research, causal inference, statistics, math, frustration tolerance and fun.
