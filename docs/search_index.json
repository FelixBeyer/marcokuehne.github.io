Only this can turn the branch into docs. Repository: https://github.com/MarcoKuehne/marcokuehne.github.io Homepage: https://marcokuehne.github.io/ Create an R project. Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. In R console use usethis::use_git(). Always gives three different answers. Confirm accordingly. 1.1 Git commands Use the terminal inside RStudio. Copy paste into terminal with: CTRL + SHIFT + V 1.1.1 git init Use git init to initialize the repository. It is used to create a new empty repository or directory consisting of files with the hidden directory. .git is created at the top level of your project, which places all of the revision information in one place. Dont know what initiliaze means. git init I would like to have something like git remote add ... and git push ..., not working. Show what is connected with git remote -v show I can add and remove origins, dont know what it means: git remote rm origin Use git add . in your bash to add all the files to the given folder. Use git status in your bash to view all the files which are going to be staged to the first commit. 1.1.2 git remote add Create git remote add git remote add origin https://github.com/MarcoKuehne/marcokuehne.github.git git remote add origin https://github.com/MarcoKuehne/marcokuehne.github.io git remote add origin https://github.com/MarcoKuehne/marcokuehne.github.io.git git remote add git@github.com:/.git git remote add git@github.com:MarcoKuehne/marcokuehne.github.git git remote add git@github.com:MarcoKuehne/marcokuehne.github.io does not appear to be a repository git remote add git@github.com:MarcoKuehne/marcokuehne.github.io.git combine both 1.1.3 git push Push means upload something git push -u origin main git push -u origin master git push origin master git push origin main git push set-upstream origin main git push -f origin main # worked somehow!!! If positive, it asks for github credentials. 1.2 How I think it works Open R project of your bookdown. knit to doc folder. Upload all changes to github page via git add and git push. Then enter your credentials. 1.2.1 Resources https://jules32.github.io/bookdown-tutorial/setup.html https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1221840/remote-origin-already-exists-on-git-push-to-a-new-repository https://jules32.github.io/bookdown-tutorial/setup.html This tutorial worked to push a book to a standard repo. But it means that i cannot be displayed since there is no doc branch?!!?!? https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/git-push-pull 1.2.2 Something else You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2021) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). References "]]
