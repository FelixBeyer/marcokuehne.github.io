Marco Kühne 2022-09-26 Dust and Dark A dusty lecture hall. The light cut through the darkness from the left side of the room. A dozen of seats in each bench, only few occupied by small groups of students who were trying to make sure that they sit far from each other and as far as possible from the lecturer. The bearish but competent assistant professor explained how to analyze and evaluate the results of various memory and cognition experiments through boxplots, t-test and the like in that software.

I fell in love with learning by teaching the moment I came across this concept. It put the experiences I made into scientific context. Studying for the undergraduate math classes, I soon became head of the study group, than a private tutor, than a student assistant and a doctoral student, now, teaching stuff for over a decade. Still, I feel that (trying) to teach stuff is the best way of learning it myself. By writing the gitbook I hope to force myself to pinpoint exactly what I know and don’t know about data and how to fill the gaps. Luckily, I am not alone with the approach of creating classes or writing books to learn: I could feel that econometrics was indispensable, and yet I was missing something. But what? It was a theory of causality […]. So, desperate, I did what I always do when I want to learn something new — I developed a course on causality to force myself to learn all the things I didn’t know.

You go from zero you hero in data analysis and data science and will become data fluent and learn major skills that you can use in your academic and business career. The ability to take data — to be able to understand it, to process it, to extract value from it, to visualize it, to communicate it — that’s going to be a hugely important skill in the next decades… Hal Varian, 2009. Googles chief economist. In: McKinsey Quarterly 2009 In addition and independent of specific career, I would like to foster people’s data literacy. Data literacy is the ability to read, understand, create, and communicate data as information. I would like to enable and empower all people to understand the data work of others. Don’t take numbers for granted. It’s a long journey to get them. Don’t be satisfied with a summary or conclusion from someone else. It’s worthwhile checking data sources and data work. Either to replicate and validate the data work of others or to form your own opinion. Not to mention, coding is fun. You might be under the impression, to code, your favorite thing must be computers. Or I’ve heard I’m bad a math, I can’t code. None of this is true. Think about it, what is your passion. Learn to code, is something that you can do. And something that may just expand the way you approach and think about the passions in your life.

The first half of the course (chapter 1 – 7) introduces all the basics from scratch. We measure and collect data to make informed decisions. Most decisions are complex, costly and have long-term implications. It is therefore vital that such decisions are based on the best available evidence. The second half of the course (chapter 8 – 13) focuses on the analysis of relationships. It opens the realm of research questions and projects. We try to answer apparently simple but intriguing questions from daily life. For example: Can money buy happiness? Does watching TV make us happy? What are the economic consequences of being left-handed? How does beauty affect your income? The workhorse procedure is regression, a statistical technique that relates a outcome variable to one or more explanatory variables.
