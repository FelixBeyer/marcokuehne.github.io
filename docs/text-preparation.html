Right at the start the exhibition propose to not only focuses about a simple exhibition but also to participate by voting during the whole time of the exhibition. The votes can be count by a small bracelet that they give you. The idea of making everyone participate make the exhibition and the statistic at the end more realistic because everyone can be different not only physically or mentally but also in the way of seeing the environmental problems or the sense of community. Berlin Global was interesting because they didnât put only one themes in the museum but a lot of important matters where exposed and explain so everybody could understand. Moreover, I really enjoyed walking in the museum with my classmates because at the same we were discovering an exhibition about a lot of subjects who makes understand the title Berlin Global, but I also talk with a lot of my classmates about the subjects we were looking at and sharing our opinions about what we were seeing was great. Or when we did some activities together because to make people participate the museum had the amazing idea to create some place in the exhibition where they are some activities. Also, after a few rooms there was a room where some important subjects like religion where explain in forms of comic and for each subject there was a colour who catches the eye attention in my opinion. Discovering about a lot of different culture but also about berlin history that maybe German people already know but for me I learn a lot of stuff about Berlin that I didnât know.  There was a fun room where you enter in a room full of mirrors and you just take headphones and you listen to famous old songs, and it was so great because I really enjoy the music and I had the impression I was in a nightclub but just by retiring the headphones you can continue the museum visit like that. But I really enjoyed this room with my friends and making choose was hard sometimes.  There was also a sculpture that I loved is the one with a face and a hand with a TV and all around is screen and cameras everywhere and I related to that because I think it really represent the world now with all the social media in my opinion. To conclude, I will talk about this exhibition to my friends because I really enjoyed the subjects that they talked about and the way they talked about them by using not only text but also some sculptures, pictures, and activities.","You can see the global nature of Berlin's food culture alone. There is every cuisine here, and that too from the native people of the kitchens. All cultures live together here.I also liked this graffiti where the colonial past is portrayed in the form of beautiful arts. These colorful drawings not only give us a lesson of history but also carry a strong message of freedom within them.I would highly recommend this exhibition.","How is globality represented in \"Berlin Global\"?Globality is represented everywhere in Berlin. The diversity is a very important thing in Berlin. Every year there is the Carnival of Cultures to celebrate the diversity. People of all the world come in Berlin to work or to study. Berlin is known as a place to be, everybody is welcoming. How is the colonial past depicted in Room 1 \"Weltdenken\" (large mural / graffiti)?In the room 1 you find a lot of graffities about the colonial past. The background is a map of the world. You find a soldier with a world map in one hand and in the second a map of Africa. It reminders that Germany had colonies there. You have also some graffities of the colonizers with weapons. The territory is represented like a cake in different pieces and the colonizers take parts as they want.","The exhibition Berlin Global shows the city itself, its people ad their connection to the global world.The main topics were revolution, free space, boundaries, entertainment, war, fashion and interconnection. The first room was called Thinking of the world and the main there was a huge mural. It takes up events that tell of the subjection and development of the world. It took the artists How&amp;Nosm three weeks to paint it. They represented four world views from the colonial division of the world to interconnection between man and nature and appropriation of cultural objects from other continents. In collage-like scenes, symbols can be discovered that stand for thinking of the world as commodity: clasped hands, broken chains and doves of peace. Artists tried to rise some questions in visitorâs minds. How do we want to live together in the world? How does this world affect us? How do we want to shape it?At the colonial part of the graffiti artists represented the portrait of Humboldt trough which they not only addressed a place where the exhibition took place, but also showed that even research traditions were closely linked to European and German colonialism. There were also painted African culture objects which are placed in European museums as a result of colonialism museum traditions. Locating this exhibition in a place which is reconstructed palace of Prussian colony also addressed special historical responsibility for the effects of colonial past. As such, colonialism influenced Berlin's relationships with the world both before 1884 and after 1919. The aftereffects of this \"colonial globality\" extend beyond formal decolonialisation in the mid-20th century and on into the present. They include economic and political inequality and dependency relationship between the global south and north. The colonial legacy also still shapes the thoughts and perceptions of many white Europeans. A striking example of this is the ongoing phenomenon of racism deriving in part from colonial mindsets of previous centuries.","It is a very interesting and interactive museum that inspires and educates on the topic of globality. Globality is something we as a species should strive to achieve but not without doing it with caution since what already is could be altered negatively. I think the museum gives great historical depictions of how globality has impacted Germany, giving the country a strong economy without running into issues that can't be fixed. The first room skillfully depicts our tendency to create barriers to protect what we have created, making it not fruitful for all impacted by the creation. Strongly recommend this museum!","It is my second time at Humboldt Forum after visiting another exhibition several weeks earlier.This one is fascinating because of the different style of displaying Berlin. I can say that I have never seen Berlin from another angle. Maybe I am not that old to know the whole history of Germanyâs capital, or I have never been able to get to know Berlin better.Most of us know about the unpopular side of history of Germany, World War II and its aftermath.It has changed Germany completely, not only the history, but also the arts, socialite, economy and religion.The first room with graffiti has shown the colonial past of Germany. Because of industrialization, it needs more raw materials. And since the country did not have any resources, African countries were its targets and have been conquered by German troops. African people were killed and used in the German wars in the 19th century.With new resources, German science has been greatly improved and its arts, cultures and medicines.Berlin has now become the German melting pot, in which people of different world cultures come and live together. It is open to everyone.From the 20s century onwards, Berlin has adapted lots of the worldâs culture, and it has created various kinds of subcultures e.g. swing, rock &amp; roll, hippies, punk and hip-hop, dominating certain time-frames in the past. Due to that, the capital is known for subculture diversity and still attracts people from all over the world.Religion has played a big role not only in Berlin history but also in the German one. There was lots of state persecution of different religions and laws against them.After World War II, restrictions were lifted, so that emigrated people are coming back to Germany and new religions are implemented and welcomed.There are also some disadvantages going global, such as controlling people through cameras and via media and the cost of living, rent included, is climbing higher and higher each year due to the high immigration rate versus less living area. It has now climbed almost to the range of Hamburg, Bremen, and different cities situated in West Germany.The capital struggled because of the privatization of public living space, fewer apartments and buildings are built due to profit orientation of companies.Nevertheless, Berlin is still a hot and trending city to work and live in. But there are still rooms for improvement.","The colonial past of Germany in the first room of the exhibition is represented by a couple graffities combined with a more detailed picture of an antique site of stone figures. The advanced weapons and brutality of their actions against the colonized people is depicted very clear and very graphic in the graffiti.Throughout the whole exhibition the globality and the intercultural connections is always referred to in one way or another, depending on the specific historical time displayed in the exhibition. When displaying holocaust survivors and victims personal belongings or the their personal history through their children and grandchildren the global connection and the influences and paths were also displayed and referred to.Even on more âmodernâ displays the globality and intercultural connections were always referred to by telling their life storyâs their struggles or their experiences.Event through historical developments and events such as music genres and fashion trends the globality and diversity is displayed much clearer and actually gives the viewer a different perspective that wasnât so clear to think about before. This way the globality that actually was always present but never much thought about is displayed.The display that had the most impact on me was the one with all the video cameras and how we actually give our personal information up so willingly but would not want to be filmed or supervised in such an obvious way","The exhibition Berlin Global shows us how the city is connected to the world through its history, social movements, culture and people. The exposition is divided into seven parts to help us going through various topics, such as Revolution, Free Space, Boundaries, Entertainment, War, Fashion and Interconnection.One of the most impressive things presented was the large graffiti presented in the first room on which the artists showed us not only that the oppression of people and nature continues to this day and the confrontation of past discoveries and current but touched on a topic such as the colonial past of Germany. By looking at the graffiti, we can see the world map and ships going on expeditions that led not only to the knowledge of the world but also to the assertion of their power, due to their enslavement of other people and seizure of resources. The exhibition is worth a visit!","Berlin Global is one of those modern exhibitions that try very hard to be many things at the same time and end up being very little. The whole thing is an amalgamation of graffiti artwork, a collection of old posters, short info-videos about historic events, random \"artistic\" installations and lots of interactive games. There is no clear focus on anything, neither in terms of topics covered nor regarding the means by which they are displayed. As a result the experience becomes rather confusing. There is also a pretty obvious and shallow political angle to it. After the second room the message becomes clear. The colonial past is evil and modern globalization and diversity exclusively positive. If that is the type of thing you are looking for, then this is definitely the right place to go. If you however expect to actually learn something interesting about the Berlins global connections throughout history you will probably leave disappointed.  I mean I get it, you are very liberal at the Humboldt Forum  - that's fine  - but that is no excuse for not having any actual content.To be fair there are a few positives. The large mural in the first room is definitely a very nice and thought provoking piece of art about Germany's colonial past and the collection of historic election posters is also quite interesting. There is also a lot of interactive games. Unfortunately I was not able to figure out why. They are not meaningful in any way, more like: \"Turn this table and you will see a video.\" For the younger audience that might be entertaining enough in itself I guess, but one wonders what these entirely pointless gimmicks are good for as there is definitely no educational benefit to it.If that were not enough, the exhibition tries to be even more interactive. Between every room there are two doors  - each with a different statement printed above it. If you walk through either your armband, that was given to you at the entrance, will register your choice. At the very end there is the possibility to print out your results and see some comparable statistics of what other people have chosen. While in theory this could be an interesting concept, it falls way short in practice. The armband doesn't register properly half of the time and even if they work the questions are somewhat puzzeling. You get to choose between statements like \"My city should be welcoming\" and \"My city should take care about it's citizens.\" This is not just far to broad to be useful, it is also not clear why these things are treated as mutual exclusive, when they are in fact not. And so this exercise ends up as another pointless gimmick.Conclusion: Berlin Global clearly tries to be something  - I have no idea what to be honest  - and ends up being some odd potpourri of half baked ideas and good intentions. Two stars for artwork and poster collection... and for effort I guess.","I personally enjoyed seeing Berlin Global once. Because I grew up in Berlin, I was very interested in the event and was able to understand and relate to a lot of it. Berlin global shows globality very well through things that make Berlin what it is. We find aspects like the second world war, the Berlin Wall, different cultures and the global problems of our world like climate change or social injustice. In addition, it is conveyed in Berlin style through graffiti in the first room, for example. The colonial past was well expressed in the first room by the graffiti wall. From the suffering of the Second World War to the post-war period to the multicultural Berlin of today, everything is included. This room 1 expresses freedom without end and gives you the feeling of \"Berlin\".","I am usually not a big fan of exhibitions however what quite surprised me was the interactive character of the exhibition. I imagine it is more appealing to a lot of people that way. The globality in âBerlin Globalâ or more likely the diversity of the exhibition is, as one would expect, mostly represented through Berlinâs history. As someone rather unknowledgeable about cultural differences even to me it felt a lot like the âglobalityâ was focused quite a lot on the differences between the Eastern and Western part of Berlin. In the brochure of the exhibition it says âWhat has been spread from Berlin to the world?â and perhaps I was not paying close enough attention to it as I had to rush through the last part but to me personally I am a bit confused about the purpose of the exhibition. Is it supposed to show how globality has influenced the city and the citizens or what influence Berlin has had on globality or as the brochure said what has been spread to the world from Berlin? For me the most globality could be seen in the very first room with the big mural, which has a bit of a negative feeling to it as a lot of the mural was depicting historical events from a European perspective.I am not very well-versed in artsy matters so it took me some time to understand what many of the depictions were supposed to represent. Some screen close to the gates to the next room helped me a lot in that regard because I have always had some trouble interpreting a deeper meaning to illustrations while looking at them on my own and I didn't really have someone to discuss it with either. An example is the how some former big world leaders decide about how to split territorial rights of specific regions amongst them as if they were a piece of cake. After some initial hesitation I thought it to actually be a quite accurate depiction of this very situation of the colonial past. On a happier note two parts of the mural depict possible future scenarios. On the one hand there are the broken chains being shown in between multiple parts of the mural indicating that the present is still chained and influenced by the colonial past but encouraging humanity to break free from those chains through communication and taking the initiative to change something. On the other hand there is the world surrounded by clasping hands, a dove potentially symbolizing freedom showing that if humans were working together and being on eye-level instead of one party looking down on another out of a false sense of superiority, real change might possibly be achieved.","I've lived in Berlin all my life, but I've never had the opportunity to visit \"Berlin Global\".  I really regret it, because I got a very good overview of Berlin and all of its sides, which was very enriching for me.  I want to go into 2 different topics in my review.  First of all, how globality is represented in \"Berlin Global\" and also how the colonial past is represented in Room 1.  Berlin Global tries to represent the world with its different cultures and ethnic groups.  The coexistence of people should be portrayed as peacefully as possible.  The graffiti show impressions of oppression, war and grief that have divided people in the past.  Especially in the 1st room you can see this clarification based on the numerous graffiti that are on the walls.  The world should be a place for everyone, according to the artists.  In the 3rd room you can see the revolutionary movements of the past, showing people who fought for peace and stood for solidarity. the colonial past still shapes people today. It is one of the main reasons why a city like Berlin, for example, is very multicultural to this day.  From the graffiti on the walls you can see how people suffered and lived their lives with war and weapons.  However, they left the hurry that has shaped today's Germany.  Music, culture, food and much more from other ethnic groups are very present in Berlin and belong to the city just like the locals. I would recommend this exhibition to everyone, including anyone who grew up here.  It's like a journey through time of Berlin's history that gives you different insights of all kinds.","This exibition gives you the right keys for thinking about Berlin problems and colonialism in general.While entering the main gate of Humbolt Forum i was questioning myself, was i entering the real subject of discussions for it's diversity and inclusivity or a part of a history left behind?The first room (where the kind exhibition worker explained us how to use our bracelets) greeted us with a satirical note. The topics such as \"Colonial hubris, \"Divison of Africa\", \"Genocide of the Hetero and Nama\", \"Charting human beings\"joined together on the main walls as an art work in a casual environment. The message was clear: \"We are all world citizens, ideas and experience should be exchanged\".","The Berlin Global exhibition takes a look at Berlin from a global perspective, focussing on art, culture, history and social matters such as racism and gender. It features many interesting historical objects such as paintings, photographs, protest signs from demonstrations, old maps and advertisements and everyday objects of interesting historical figures. However, as interesting as the selection of topics and objects is, I couldnât help but feel like the exhibition paints a generally negative image of globality, as exemplified by the first room âWeltdenkenâ, whose dimly lit walls are covered in a somber-coloured mural depicting scenes of violence, pollution and chaos from the colonial era. The subjects of colonialism and racism appear again and again, for example in a 20 minute film featuring actors of colour born in Germany, describing their experience with stereotypical portrayals of Africans in the Nazi era movie industry as well as todays racism in social media and everyday life. Arguably global success-stories such as international trade or the international organisations arenât addressed by the exhibition at all. A silver lining however is drawn by a room depicting the political and social progress made in different areas such as religious freedom or gender equality; and another room I found particularly interesting is mainly focussing on different cultures in Berlin and contains a collection of posters advertising concerts by numerous internationally acclaimed artists such as David Bowie or the Beach Boys. A hint of positivity was also added in the mural of the first room in which the artists added white doves shattering chains and a bunch of hands reaching out for each other across planet Earth, which I interpret as expressing the artists' hope that the globality of the past, constituted by violence and exploitation, is replaced by a globality of peace and cooperation. Furthermore, there is an interactive element to the exhibition inasmuch as the visitor is asked to use a digital wristband to answer questions or choose between statements by interacting with the screens or by walking through certain doors. An evaluation of the visitors dominating values is printed at the end of the exhibition. As creative and refreshing the idea is, I canât help but feel that the reductive and often dualistic choices one has to choose between make it questionable whether the end result is meaningful at all. All in all, I still enjoyed the visit. As someone well-versed in history, by focussing on cultural and social developments, the exhibition brought themes and issues to my mind I wouldn't normally research and thus broadened my horizon. I would recommend a visit, but not without pleading to not let the somber beginnings of globality, namely colonialism and imperialism, overshadow the chances of a more interconnected world.","While the exhibition was tremendous event a person can visit and learn more about things in depth as it is very informative. While the concept that I perceived was that how much changes we have brought into this world in every aspects whether its music, culture, technology etc. I was getting the vibe that being innovative is the best thing and making things as better as possible because at the end hard work pays off and the world will benefit out of it.  It also tells you about the history including the era of colonization and the after effects of it and that depicted me that either you have to work hard to get on the top or you become a slave.","The focus of this exhibition is clearly set on Berlin and the way it evolved throughout the years. The development of the metropolis is depicted from various perspectives. An undeniable advantage of the exhibition is the intergration of new technologies, which makes the visit to Berlin Global interactive and even more captivating. A recurring theme that one can observe in the exhibition is globality - how it impacted Berlin and, at the same time, how Berlin influenced the world. The whole exhibition is divided into several rooms, each of them showcasing a different aspect of the city, such as colonial times, war, entertainment or fashion. One exhibition room, i.e. \"Thinking The World\", presents  the world history with the means of a huge colorful graffitti, depiting  colonial times, how countries have been intertwined throughout centuries and other crucial historical events. The message behind the lively drawings is very saddening though - our world has been always a witness of greed, exploitation, killing and other atrocities that human race would commit.Global Berlin enables its visitors to dive into an interesting, at times suprising tale of the world's history (with a string focus on Berlin), an unforgettable experience enhanced by the new technologies.","I have been living near Berlin since more than three years but never had a chance to visit this Exhibition before. It was my first time and it was totally worth it. Berlin is a city with an unbelievable blend of rich history, diversity and serenity. A true depiction of such a mix in form of an exhibition is same like \"Fitting an ocean into the cup\" but \"Berlin Global\" is near to exception in this regard. A few hours in this exhibition already shows you amazing glimpses of historic moments, fashion, music and overall \"Berliner\" vibe. I also liked this graffiti where the colonial past is portrayed in the form of beautiful arts. These colorful drawings not only give us a lesson of history but also carry a strong message of freedom within them. I would highly recommend this exhibition even if you are not a big fan of exhibitions and museums (Just like me) as this one is different just as the Berlin is ;)","For me the âGlobalâ part was actually kind of missing. The whole exhibition seemed to me more like Berlin in contemporary history until today. In my opinion the music and culture section was a bit pointless. I mean yesâ¦ hip hop came up in the 80âs and was a big thing in Germany and Berlin but where in the world did it not become a trend. To me that doesnât seem to be very special/unique. Therefore Iâd rather recommend the Movie âB-Movieâ which actually talks about culture and scene in Berlin and also focuses on it being one of the places to be during the 70âs and 80âs Time.Overall the topics were very interesting and surely Berlin did have a big impact on the global world but unfortunately in my opinion fails to thoroughly bring up these impacts. Maybe itâs worth a trip if you donât really know a lot about it but history fans will know most of the information already. On the other hand the first room which has a big mural is quite cool and makes a lot of connections between colonial history and the postcolonial world. Bringing up topics like the development of medicine which advanced a lot through human rights violations in the past. In retrospective wouldâve liked to see more like the first room which left space for a lot of interpretation unlike the rest of the exhibition that seemed a little too superficial to me trying to cover to many aspects of the history.","The exibition demonstrates that global challenges do not stop at borders. Military conflicts, migration, climate change from uncontrolled growth, environmental destruction, social injustice, human exploitation and limited resources - these problems affect everyone. Solving them will require overcoming the world's divisions. Small details and big pictures, the local and the global, need to be viewed together. Global networks should form, and ideas and experience should be exchanged. We are all world citizens.The walls of the room 1 \"Weltdenken\" are coverd in paitings which illustrate the centuries of charting, dividing and ruling the world continuesly having effect to this day. They cannot simply be erased. But we should take initiative and attempt to throw off the chains of the past. Communication is the leitmotif of this call for liberation - we need to talk to one another!","Globality is presented through several aspects for which Berlin is so famous. These aspects are war, revolution, borders, fashion, free space, interconnection and entertainment. They are shortly introduced together in one room through photos taken in Berlin and short explanations of their meaning for the city. In addition, each aspect has its own room, which is dedicated to the topic and further discusses its connection to Berlin. To illustrate the globality of the city different approaches are taken. For instance, there are shown numerous photos and stories of members of ethnic groups living in Berlin, vintage posters of international musicians, who were performing in the city or comics depicting the ethnic influences on evolution of art and subculture in Berlin. The exhibitionâs orientation on globality is also expressed in an attempt to get visitors involved by expressing their opinions through special wristbands. The wristbands enable to take part in voting about topics concerning future with regard to globality. There are also other interactive elements such as possibility to listen to old music recordings or personal stories of foreigners who have left their home countries and moved to Berlin.The graffiti shows events from the colonial times (e.g. Conquest of America, Berlin Conference) and their impact on people and environment. It portrays violent treatment of natives by colonizers and how these actions negatively affected culture (prejudices about other races) and nature (pollution). The Humboldt brothers are also incorporated in the composition. Their presence symbolizes science and its advancement, which is positive, but it also has a negative side, because this would be not possible without the support of colonialist. Whatâs more, the graffiti depicts the symbols of peace and connection, which should probably stand for peaceful solving of problems though cooperation and dialogue. To conclude, it's a nice exihibition, but I don't have a need to go there again.","The exhibition intricately captures the spirit of the capital city, Berlin, showcasing the various facets that the city is endowed with. It throws light on the significant events which occurred in the past, that in turn shaped the city into what it is today. Globality is represented via stories, graffiti and installations covering topics like Fashion, Free Space, Boundaries, Entertainment etc. These features attempt to depict the interconnection of Berlin with the rest of the world.The exhibition delicately encounters sensitive topics such War, Gender Identity and Revolution. It is indeed fascinating to have such a wonderful representation of history, cultures, divisions and interconnections that root from the colonial period. There are so many interesting aspects of the exhibition, but the ones that caught my eye were the time wheel and the space where you can put on headphones and dance to the retro-beats or so I would say! (maybe think of something like a silent disco). Another interesting thing about the exhibition is that it is highly interactive as it requires you to make choices at several instances and you can also present your opinions at certain points by voting which is facilitated by a wrist band provided to you at the beginning. The colonial past is depicted in the first room through graffiti, murals and installations that describe the significant events that occurred in the past. One can derive a clear picture of the devastating effects of wars and slave trade. Further, you also get insights into the revolutions in detail through videos from the colonial time that has today resulted in the unique essence of the city.Overall, the exhibition flawlessly displays the rich culture and diversity the city holds. I would highly recommend visiting Humboldt Forum and have this amazing experience.","I really like the idea of this exhibition that use the technology, the watch and those creative design in every room, to let visitors interact with several topics. At first, I was amazed by the watch and the different languages they use in the system. At every entry of a room, one choice of two different thoughts about a topic needed to be done, which was not just interesting but made people to think about the topics. Through this exhibition, globality and diversity are everywhere. In the room âthinking of the worldâ, huge graffiti was all around the wall showing the history of colonial, the progress of technology and its effects and some symbols and words of other countries to express a wish to make the world a home or to make people from wherever to think about our own planet. The graffiti of colonial past unabashedly showed both the cruelty of colonization and its contribution to the world puzzle. Just like other topics, it shows the bright side, the ambitions and achievable powerful future of the European rulers, but also shows the dark side, the failed resistance and the treated-as-goods future of the colonized people.Besides the room âthinking of the worldâ, what captured my eyes was the room âfree spaceâ and âentertainmentâ. The former showed the changes, regards to culture, art and acceptance of cross gender, of berlin people. The latter was not just about those entertainment revolution, but involved the integration of people with different background and how they fighted for their right and the equality. This exhibition was truly meaningful and presented the globality and the diversity in Berlin.","The exhibition is very modern and tries to represent the connection around the world using different topics such as the history, art and much more.Right at the beginning everyone gets a bracelet that tracks which decision one is taking and that will be analyzed and compared to the other visitors at the end. The exhibition displays the development which was influenced by historical events all over the world and by people of different cultures.The exhibition shows the global effect without which Berlin probably wouldnât be that multicultural and open-minded as it is today. There are videos of foreigners and people who seem to be different than others in some peoples eyes taking about how life was like for them being treated differently often with much hate and how it has changed over time. This shows how people who were outcasts once, became part of the society as society has changed in the past due to many influences and changes in peoples mind. This is one example, but there are much more illustrations of how globality had a positive impact. The exhibition represents how people of different ethnic groups and ages enjoy time together through music or events and creating new styles by combining various cultural influences. This impact of mixing different cultures also influenced many other sectors. The first room illustrates the colonial past using scenes where people are fighting and discovering new areas, but also displaying a mixture of cultures by showing things that are typical for these countries and putting them together. We can see blood and destruction, but on the other hand there are also a lot of doves and broken chains that initiate a change. Furthermore, this room shows us that the world should stick together and reach for peace. Seeing that, one can also interpret that they want to express that challenges and hard times can be overcome when cultures are combined and creating a better world where people help each other.I really liked the turning table which combines history with modern technology with the thought of connecting people. Each piece containing a year has to be loaded by putting the hands under the table. This is can be easily done, when more people are helping. By turning the table, a year can be chosen to learn more about the events of that particular year which will then be shown on a screen around the table. Although I usually avoid going to exhibitions, I would recommend going to Berlin Global, because it is different compared to other exhibitions.","Berlin Global is a very deep, touching and interesting as well as modern exhibition at the Humbold Forum. It was not my first visit and yet new aspects keep catching my eye.  It shows how Berlin is connected to the world and people from all over the world come together and connect. The many different exhibits, of the individual artists, embody the globality to which the name \"Berlin Global\" draws attention. I do not want to reveal too much to let everyone his personal first impression, so just a little something as a foretaste to the first room: In room 1, the wall graffiti refers to historical events and symbols from different cultures. The entire 360Â° of the room shows what happened in the colonial past and also who had to suffer from it, like how inhabitants trying to defend themselves with wooden spears against metal","Berlin is a city located in the heart of Europe and it is unavoidable not to be affected by many cultures. In Berlin Global, Berlinâs past is represented with various items such as videos, pictures. There I found information which is not only about Berlin. I learned how people live their lives differently even in similar locations. In different times of the world.In Room 1, the mural graffiti refers to historical events, symbols from various cultures, the events that the whole world is affected by. It shows what was done in the colonial past. For example, it shows how underdeveloped nations try to fight against guns with their wooden spears. It also depicts the effects of colonialism on nature. Historical characters that have huge effects on today's society are drawn in this graffiti.","Exhibition âBerlin GlobalâI can recommend with confidence the exhibition Berlin Global for anyone interested in comprehending the cityâs and worlds history, culture and identity through a new angle. The interactive exhibition located in the Humboldt forum near Alexander Platz is easy to reach (by bike it took me 6 mins) and because of its interactive approach and innovative storytelling adequate for people of all ages. The idea of following your own path through the exhibition by making choices and selecting specific situations is very impressive and something I have never seen before. You can clearly see the globality of this exhibition through different work of art and graffities one that really caught my attention was âMy revolutionâ which covered major revolutionary events in the modern history like the Arab Spring revolutions.Throughout all rooms of the exhibition the observer is confronted with different topics that animate to question the positive and negative parts of globalization (not only specifically in berlin, but in the world) and if the city is as border-less, free and interconnected as it appears at first glance. For example, there is a large graffiti deals with many different subjects seen in the exhibition: from terrible events that shaped Europe such as the colonization racism &amp; the realities of wars, to early scientific research and the relationship between humans and nature. All in all, the exhibition as a hole invites the observer to reflect where berlin is now a days and where society is heading.","The exhibition has innately depicted several instalments which speaks about the  capital city of Germany. Showcasing the topics of history, times of World War, struggle of different troops during the time, devastating effects of the war, developments in the lifestyle, culture and many more. Installations are put together in a manner that they are somewhat interactive and pretty intriguing at the same time. For instance, the voting system throughout the exhibition was quite appealing, one has to choose between two doors with some questions like - âI want to help the worldâ and âI want to help my communityâ in order to enter a new section.  Some serious issues like Racism and transgender identity had also a special place at this exhibition. The section where it had the DJ mixer was one of my favourite sections, it said about the kind of music Berliners are used to listening to.   â¨â¨The colonial past is portrayed with the help of different paintings on the walls, various topics like exploitation, slavery, harassment, inequality were described through these murals.","When entering the exhibition on is greeted with a room where all the walls are covered in a huge graffiti. Different events and effects of colonialism are shown in different parts of the graffiti. The division of countries by longitude and latitude instead of existing cultural realities and the war and destruction that  this devisions lead to, the destruction of non european history and works of arts, the horrors of slave trade, and the justification of discriminatory policies by \"seintific\" means. It is worth to spend a lot of time in this room, there are a lot of noticable detail.The rest of the exhibition feels a little like an exhibition on Berlin, its history and current state.  I was hoping for more detail on the various ways Berlin is globally connected. These connections were in the exhibition, but a little hidden some personal stories  of people comming to or going from Berlin as well of a few examples like how our clothes are produced. Every person visiting the exhibition got a bracelet whit which one could make some decisions during the exhibition. Ad the end one could compare the personal decisions with that of other visitors. A cool idea, but sadly there were a lot of technical problems.","Berlin Global attempts to show ways in which the world is connected. The exhibition highlights challenges the world faces and that need to be viewed in a global perspective, because they affect many people beyond country borders. It makes visitors aware of these issues, and encourages us to think about them and exchange our thoughts with other people. The exhibition succeeds in providing input for such discussions, however I do miss more depth in the presentation of some of the different themes. But as a general introduction, it works really well. The exhibition has a high degree of interactivity, lots of artwork and information to read. If you want the full experience, you could easily spend at least two hours here.In the first room, visitors can observe a large mural depicting scenes of European conquest. The painting shows different aspects of the history of this, such as the subjugation of land and people, the division of these areas among colonial powers and the subsequent exploitation of native populations and areas. However, the painting also portrays the brothers Wilhelm and Alexander von Humboldt and their shared interest in topics concerning global interconnection and diversity, showing appreciation for the uniqueness of all cultures, which stands in contrast to the general sentiment of the colonial past, where European cultures were viewed as superior.At the beginning of the exhibition, you also have the opportunity to receive a chip wristband that you wear throughout your visit. This is supposed to provide additional interactivity as well as give you the opportunity to find out more about yourself and the choices you make. However, in the end, this turned out to be more confusing and distracting than useful, and did not add much to the experience for me.","I see the exhibition \"Berlin Global\" as an excellent opportunity to understand the connection between Berlin's past and present. What I really like about this exhibition is that it does not represent the point of view of only one ethnic or cultural group; instead, the \"Berlin Global\" exhibition allows you to learn how people from different backgrounds perceive their lives and events in a different way. As for the organisational part of the exhibition, it includes various ways of communicating the events of the past, including texts, videos, graphics, interactive activities and games.My first impression of Global Berlin came from the room called \"Weltdenken\". It is very beautiful, with graffiti on the walls, and this modern designed room tells us the story of colonisation. I think it is no coincidence that this room is the first one, because it shows us clearly that we have to be aware of the events that happened in the past. It also shows that Germany is linked to the events that happened during the time of colonisation, namely exploitation, discrimination, but also exploration of the world. I think one of the points is that people on both sides of the historical events perceive these events differently. While the early Europeans may have seen colonisation as a key to continued growth, the colonised countries experienced a lot of suffering and pain. Basically, I think this play wants to remind us of those events that happened before us, so that we don't take for granted what we have now, but that we also remember that history has evolved for us in different ways. Ethnic and cultural diversity is one way of seeing Berlin as a global place. The people of Berlin come from a variety of ethnic, cultural and religious backgrounds. These differences, which at some points in history were seen as a border, are now seen as a choice to which every individual is equally entitled. As an example, I remember a video in which three women are having a very friendly conversation. What is specific to this video is that these women believe in three different religions, namely Christianity, Islam and Judaism. Although they come from different places, they recognise that there is nothing wrong with being different and they also show a desire to learn more about each other's culture. In addition, there were several charts on the wall on topics such as religious practices, arts, politics, etc., which show historical trends in a chronological way. Here we can see many historical events that happened in the past. Specifically, I remember when the first hippie community appeared in 1967. What is interesting is that it shows the interconnection between world events and Berlin's relationship to them. We could also see on the graph when the first hippie communities developed later in Germany. Below you can see some of the pictures I made on these graphs.","Berlin Global is a quite interesting and modern museum. It shows how Berlin is connected to the world. The museum represents globality through many different interactive exhibition pieces. We can find there 7 main topics such as revolution, entertainment, war, fashion, boundaries, interconnection and free space. There is a huge globe in the first room that shows different points connected to each other. Also there are beautiful graffity all over the walls where we could see how the whole world was presented from the colonialism era till the present.At the doors(corners) there were questions that made us make decisions with our bracelets. Sometimes it was a little bit difficult to choose the right statement personally for me. And it made me think, and that is good. I learned lots about history, Berlin, fashion, art. It helps me to make sense of the world, cross the border, feel intertwining the lives of people from different countries by their stories. It took more that 3 hours to see all the beauties of this exhibition and think about globalization, art, people. Highly recommend to visit this place.","The exhibition was very interesting and informative, there were a lot of interactive objects, so it wasn't boring at all. The first room featured colorful graffiti painted on 4 walls. The first room featured colorful graffiti. I spent a long time looking at the walls, where there were pictures of warlike people, ships, weapons, maps, houses, animals, and aborigines. It was an exhibition on the theme of colonialism. The graffiti made me think of problems like looted art, pollution, and violence against the local population of the colonies. I was able to recognize famous figures such as the Humboldt brothers, Elector Friedrich Wilhelm, and Christopher Columbus, who are also connected to the history of colonization. I think that the exhibition is called \"Global Berlin\" because it raises important and global themes related to Berlin - a megalopolis of global significance.  Topics that are important for all humanity are presented at the exhibition. Revolution, Free Space, Borders, Entertainment, War, Fashion, and Interconnection.I really liked the bracelet voting idea. I was also fascinated by the time wheel.","The globality of the \"Berlin Global\" is represented through 7 perspectives, namely through Revolution, Free Space, Boundaries, Entertainment, War, Fashion, and Interconnection. Each perspective showed how the city has impacted the world and at the same time how the world has impacted this great city.  I was imperessed by the graffiti in the first room which depicted different historic events starting with the 1492 with Christopher Columbus landing on the Bahamas, which basically was a starting point of the colonization of the New World, or depiction of the transportation of the slaves from one of the first German colony in Ghana to the new world or division of Africa by European powers, which resulted in the first genocide of the XXth century.  Also, it is interesting the way the authors of the mural showed how the colonial powers used science and scientists in their pursuit to more power and control.","How is globality represented in \"Global Berlin\"?âGlobal Berlinâ shows many different parts of Berlin's globality. It represents globality through many different interactive and traditional exhibition pieces. The first room sets the mood for the theme with a giant globe that shows different points connected to each other. Global Berlin is divided into several different sections of various topics and shows the global aspects of each topic. For instance, the section \"Berlin Images\" shows Berlin's nightlife history of the 1920s and points out that many musicians from all over the world took part in its glorious time. Also, \"Berlin Images\" notes that break-dance rose in the 1980s on the streets of West- and East Berlin and therefore shaped Berlin's society ever since. The exhibition pieces are partly interactive by gathering information about the visitorâs opinion on certain subjects and reporting the answers at the end in comparison to other visitorsâ answers. This interactive feature lets the visitor realize how they are influenced by globality in their everyday life and their attitude toward globality. The noninteractive exhibition pieces are short documentaries, paintings, and historical relics about positive aspects of globality in Berlin such as diversity, innovation, and progress but also negative aspects such as discrimination. How is the colonial past depicted in Room 1 âWeltdenkenâ?Room 1 shows a large mural in graffiti style and displays the different colonial divisions of the world. Even though it is in a graffiti style the mural was showing collage-like scenes of breaking with the colonial times and standing up against the system of injustice for which colonial times stand. These different little stories as part of the mural show for instance a pigeon, the forgiveness and freedom, flying away with a chain in its beak, leaving behind an empty cage. The statue of liberty is looking towards the scene while being blindfolded which reminds the observer of lady justice also known as goddess Justicia of roman mythology. The scene seems like a homage to the American revolution of overcoming the injustice of its colonial past.","The Berlin Global exposition in the Humboldt Forum puts an emphasis on globality in the city of Berlin. In fact, Berlin due to its past but also to its capital status is a very cosmopolite city. The city even celebrates diversity every year at an even called âthe Carnival of Culturesâ.  The past explains nowadaysâ diversity in Berlin. With the persecution of people (especially during the Nazi dictatorship), the city now understands the importance of accepting diversity.  The same reflection can be seen through colonialism. In the first room we can observe a painting on the right side representing the colonial past.  We can clearly see an opposition between the right side which is the local people defending its land with shields and more âtraditionalâ weapons like knives, swords and spears, only a few of them have guns.  However, on the left side we have colonialists who are all equipped with guns, they are more equipped overall, and the battle is therefore unfair from the start. They are depicted as non-human beings as the look on their eyes is completely empty. We can also see a commander holding a map of Africa which we know for a fact, is part that was probably the most affected by colonialism. He is brandishing it as he is claiming the continent.  Overall, the colors chosen by the artist are really dark and pale, giving the painting a not so joyful atmosphere. A lot of black ink, dark purple, pink, red,â¦ Diversity is also expressed through the art we can observe in Berlin. The city is known for its cultural diversity, in music, street art, or fashion.  The Humboldt Museum is itself related to Globality. The Humboldt brothers who founded the Museum were passionate about interconnections around the world. They loved to travel and speaks other languages. Therefore, the museum reflects their attraction towards globality.","In the different rooms, different topics are presented. Also the change of renting and housing is shown, as well as the change of lifestyle in Berlin.There was one interactive screen where it was possible to depict the connection that each individual visitor has to the world. Also there were some listening features, where different people talked about their lives. In one corner the whole sexuality and gender topic was present and how this changed over time. There was one condom automat. The import of rubber made it possible to produce those. The exploitation of other cultures has been pushed into the background for this topic. For the clothing corner that was more present. Also the topic of sustainability was present. The basic topics are Fashion, Revolution, Clearance, Borders, Amusement, War and Interconnection. Each subject is affected by globalization. All in all, the whole exhibition was more about history of Berlin than about Globality as its own. The entry walls and the wall on the left hand side depict different signs of the colonial past, especially slavery. It starts with the discovery of America in 1492 and ends with the exploitation of human capital.My favourite part of the exhibition was the decision making with the bracelets. At different corners or doors there were questions. The answers werenât very precise, but it was interesting to see peoples answers. The summary of the answers at the end could have been a little bit more creative. ","Quite interesting modern museum, established in the classic building. Already the first room is very impressing, as it depicts colonial past of Germany (especially exciting for people from abroad). However, it is presented in the very up-to-date form with many interactive elements and large images in style of modern art. It is worth to advise to plan some time to narrowly analyse the whole mural and make our own interpretation of this. The thing I liked the most in this room was the possibility to read about Alexander von Humboldt, as well as about his less famous brother Wilhelm, and his attitude towards colonialism.In other rooms we can learn more about Berlin in global context. We will not find here many âtypicalâ museum exhibits â there is many interactive elements there. Of course, we can come upon some older/ original items, like e.g. stands, made from the original, old photographs, presenting the war time or entertainment in the twenties. I personally enjoyed the most the area of the propagandist posters from the beginning of the 20s (what for sure depends on the interests). Reading them was very surprising for me, also a little bit funny and informative.Presented historical objects are quite well interacted with modern elements to make it easier for the visitor to see the place of Berlin in the global context. It allows to better understand the current place of Berlin, and Germany at all, in the world perspective. Because I donât come from Germany, many issues were new for me and thus very informative. I liked the idea to present the history of the âglobalityâ in Berlin and how it influences the present.","Globality means to be connected, united and even working together to make the world a better place, even though deep down every individual is different or shares other interests. For this to work, being open to new things and changes is crucial.Berlin Global shows how Berlin is connected to the world. It divides GLOBALITY into 7 main topics such as revolution, free space, boundaries, entertainment, war, fashion and even interconnection.Berlin Global shows deep insights into the past and the process how Berlin has transformed to one of the most open cities in the world with people from all over the world calling it their home today.Berlin often promotes the feeling of being different or imperfect which implicates perfection and makes it the perfect place. The colonial past is described as a dark time in human history although it connected the world and promoted global trade as we know today. One may also say it was the beginning of globality.","The exhibition turned out to be fun and engaging. The interactive components helped me understand the presented information better and to feel in the past. The rooms were very big and going through each of them and actively engaging with the content was later a bit exhausting, however, given unlimited time it was still an enriching experience.     The first room was painted with graffiti which looked nice on the first sight but upon closer look it became apparent that the graffiti depicted an overall history of colonial past with the black-and-white drawings combined with pinkish background colours portraying typical moments and emotions of these periods â greed, stealing, killing, or exploitationBerlin Global exhibition tried to show the globality of Berlin through its culture, history and people. All the components helped to shape Berlin into the state it is nowadays, however, these components are also what connects people around the world.Definitely recommend it!","My personal impression about the Humboldt Museum is a good one. In my opinion, the pieces and artefacts in the museum truly depicts the theme âBerlin Globalâ. Alexander von Humboldt described the world as an ecosystem in which everything is interconnected and I believe this statement is the central idea of globality. The first picture attached was the most memorable pictures I took at the exhibition. Interestingly, I did not expect to see a common household item from my home country at the exhibition. This artefact although small truly depicts globality to me. It brought a sense of belongingness. The display of very sentimental objects from all over the world stimulates interaction and promotes a deeper understanding among people of the world. I was also impressed about how candid the interviews were. From the few I listened to, I realized that although people are learning to respect and accept different cultures, there are still so many conservatives who are not willingly to accept people for who they are.The mural depicts the role the colonial past played in bringing the world together. The bonds between continents date back centuries. World wars, slavery and other world events played a huge role in the centralization of cultureThe world is indeed a global village and Humboldt truly depicts how much the world has evolved, the role the colonial past plays in globality and learning to accept and respect different cultures.","The exhibition made me aware of some perspectives neglected in my surroundings. I have constantly felt like an outsider in Germany since I was a foreigner. Subtle things such as friends hanging out in the Mauerpark, seeing graffiti on the street, listening to people talk about the east and the west Berlin, or the rental price is never rising to make me think about the background behind it and what it relates. I have never lived in Berlin, but I spent six years in Frankfurt (Oder). At first, I was not expecting myself to be able to comprehend the concept that this exhibition wanted to deliver. However, many things rang a bell, and I started feeling related. That was when I realized that I am part of the community as well. As presented in the first room, Thinking the World, they reinforced the idea that we are the world, and colonialism shaped many thoughts and actions we have now. The greed of human beings in history tells us the consequence and the price it came along. My country, Taiwan, was colonized by several nations before. And now I am living in Germany, where it inhabited other places. But now, people worldwide gather and live in this community and share the same territory. However, the boundaries created in the past still exist nowadays. Also, what I like about the exhibition is that they cover different angles toward the big picture. It can be that you are listening to someone elseâs story, but the next place you arrive, you are listening to your own. The exhibition emphasizes the disturbance of cultures, humanities, environment, interaction, etc., that resulted from the colonial past. Regarding the option of collecting our thoughts throughout the exhibition, my result showed me that my primary value lies in security. I feel like a foreigner in Germany, and those boundaries often exclude me. However, if I return to Taiwan and think about this question again, I may say that the limits make me feel safe. This exhibition allows me to think from a different point of view. It encouraged me to learn from the past and make better decisions for the future.","Two weeks ago I visited the \"Berlin Global\" exhibition at the Humboldt Forum. From my point of view, globality was explained in a very visual way and represented as a combination of all aspects of the worldwide life and historial events. We learned the most important things that normally people see as a characteristic of the city of Berlin as can be entertainment, free spaces, war, interconnectionâ¦ and why are these its characteristics from its historical background.It is a huge exposition but I think it is worth to talk about the first room where we could see how the whole world was represented through graffiti all over the walls, from the colonialism era until the present. There we could see representations of different economic, cultural and personal ties between cities and continents such as the linguistic diversity, cultural hierarchies, education, interaction and interconnections between nature and culture, wars, pollution issues and many more. At the end, I think that one of the aims of this room is to make us aware of how taking responsibility as a world citizen, global networks, respect for other cultures and diversity, awareness and education can help to avoid divisions, to tackle the challenges of a global present and future, to discover new perspectives on the world and to break the chains of the past in order to evolve to a better and liberated future.","Howâs globality represented in Berlin global?In the exhibition there are several rooms that represent the globality of Berlin in a unique way. Each room tells its own story and reflects the specificity of the city. In total, the space is divided into 7 thematic complexes that represent globality: Revolution, Free Space, Boundaries, Entertainment, War, Fashion and Interconnection. Every room shows how Berlin has affected the world in the past, and now also in the present. Personally Room âEntertainmentâ impressed most. Berlinâs entertainment culture has always thrived on communicating with the world. Music and dance, theatre and cinema draw on a wide variety of influences. From tango to techno, from swing to hip-hop Berlinâs dancefloors play musical styles from all over the world. Howâs the colonial past depicted in Room 1 âWeltdenkenâ ? First, the graffiti deals with the European journeys of exploration and conquest around 1500. Sent by European rulers, seafarers claimed possession of regions they reached. Enslavement of millions of people and global trade in raw materials boosted the economies of Europe and North America. Further, Wilhelm and Alexander von Humboldt are seen on the mural. Both were interested in global topics throughout their lives. Wilhelm studied more than seventy languages whereas Alexander loved to travel. Finally, the grafitti shows how the German empire began claiming colonies in Africa, Asia and the Pacific in 19th century. Cultural treasures and everyday objects from the colonies landed in European museums often questionable means.","Last month I attended exhibition \"Berlin Global\" in Humboldt Forum, which was dedicated to the diversity and differences within the city (in many spheres e.g. cultural, sexual etc.). I was indeed impressed by this exhibition as I usually do not expect much of such cultural events (mainly because normally they contain overwhelmingly much theoretical information that is hard to digest in a couple of hours).However, âBerlin Globalâ is a completely different case. Right from the beginning there were a lot of different installations that were interesting to explore. I was especially impressed by the scale of this Berlinâs diversity and globality â it feels in everything. Starting from the obvious thing â the Wall, built to divide people and separate them from each other, and moving on to gender differences and cultural diversity â all these represent diverse network world, existing in Berlin.I was fascinating to explore how people protested against inequality, against racial prejudice â and all that happened in one German city. At this time, you can fully understand why people call Berlin a global city â here all is mixed together, people from many countries, with different attitudes toward the life in general â and everyone feels comfortable.Particularly interesting was to understand that this diversity and globality is not a recent trend. On the contrary, Berlin used to be brutal and free city for a long time. In the Room 1 âWeltdenkenâ the large geometrical black figure with different white lines can be seen, which, from my point of view, represents different footprints left from people all around the world.Below, I am including several photos that I like the most â all of them highlight the globality of Berlin, it is traceable in different ways in each installation.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the excursion; I understood the capital of Germany deeper, and I can only recommend visiting âBerlin Globalâ.","Berlin Global combines modernity and history in it's different halls, on one hand you learn about historical events around the globe which gives the globality the exhibition wishes to convey on its visitors and on the other hand it has interactive areas where the visitor needs to make a decision which sometimes could be an ethical or personal dilemma.In one of the rooms an aesthetically pleasing mural is depicting the colonial past in different parts of the world such as Africa whilst being mixed with different historical events in an artistic fashion thus combining the problems of the world in the past in a way that we can relate to in this day and age.All in all a great experience and would definitely recommend a visit.","Berlin Global feels very modern. It combines historic information and stories with modern art and design plus interactive features. The interation comes from decision you can make on your own as well as interactive elements such as the wheel that requires about 5 people to start a video sequence. It triggers interaction between visitors and people who are normally strangers who would not have interacted otherwise. I think it is definitely suitable for school classes and seminar groups (education price is free). It's educational and fun. Although it covers some of the darktest parts of history. From my perspective, it makes sense to attract normal people first by art or eye-catcher and confront them step by step with the historic stories and elements. Overall, the visit has been an exiting trip and I recommend people to attend this exibition at the heart of Berlin."],["thursday  of november we went to discover the exhibition who take place in  about berlin global right at the start the exhibition propose to not only focuses about a simple exhibition but also to participate by voting during the whole time of the exhibition the votes can be count by a small bracelet that they give you the idea of making everyone participate make the exhibition and the statistic at the end more realistic because everyone can be different not only physically or mentally but also in the way of seeing the environmental problems or the sense of community berlin global was interesting because they didnt put only one themes in the museum but a lot of important matters where exposed and explain so everybody could understand moreover i really enjoyed walking in the museum with my classmates because at the same we were discovering an exhibition about a lot of subjects who makes understand the title berlin global but i also talk with a lot of my classmates about the subjects we were looking at and sharing our opinions about what we were seeing was great or when we did some activities together because to make people participate the museum had the amazing idea to create some place in the exhibition where they are some activities also after a few rooms there was a room where some important subjects like religion where explain in forms of comic and for each subject there was a colour who catches the eye attention in my opinion discovering about a lot of different culture but also about berlin history that maybe german people already know but for me i learn a lot of stuff about berlin that i didnt know  there was a fun room where you enter in a room full of mirrors and you just take headphones and you listen to famous old songs and it was so great because i really enjoy the music and i had the impression i was in a nightclub but just by retiring the headphones you can continue the museum visit like that but i really enjoyed this room with my friends and making choose was hard sometimes  there was also a sculpture that i loved is the one with a face and a hand with a tv and all around is screen and cameras everywhere and i related to that because i think it really represent the world now with all the social media in my opinion to conclude i will talk about this exhibition to my friends because i really enjoyed the subjects that they talked about and the way they talked about them by using not only text but also some sculptures pictures and activities","you can see the global nature of berlins food culture alone there is every cuisine here and that too from the native people of the kitchens all cultures live together herei also liked this graffiti where the colonial past is portrayed in the form of beautiful arts these colorful drawings not only give us a lesson of history but also carry a strong message of freedom within themi would highly recommend this exhibition","how is globality represented in berlin globalglobality is represented everywhere in berlin the diversity is a very important thing in berlin every year there is the carnival of cultures to celebrate the diversity people of all the world come in berlin to work or to study berlin is known as a place to be everybody is welcoming how is the colonial past depicted in room  weltdenken large mural  graffitiin the room  you find a lot of graffities about the colonial past the background is a map of the world you find a soldier with a world map in one hand and in the second a map of africa it reminders that germany had colonies there you have also some graffities of the colonizers with weapons the territory is represented like a cake in different pieces and the colonizers take parts as they want","the exhibition berlin global shows the city itself its people ad their connection to the global worldthe main topics were revolution free space boundaries entertainment war fashion and interconnection the first room was called thinking of the world and the main there was a huge mural it takes up events that tell of the subjection and development of the world it took the artists hownosm three weeks to paint it they represented four world views from the colonial division of the world to interconnection between man and nature and appropriation of cultural objects from other continents in collagelike scenes symbols can be discovered that stand for thinking of the world as commodity clasped hands broken chains and doves of peace artists tried to rise some questions in visitors minds how do we want to live together in the world how does this world affect us how do we want to shape itat the colonial part of the graffiti artists represented the portrait of humboldt trough which they not only addressed a place where the exhibition took place but also showed that even research traditions were closely linked to european and german colonialism there were also painted african culture objects which are placed in european museums as a result of colonialism museum traditions locating this exhibition in a place which is reconstructed palace of prussian colony also addressed special historical responsibility for the effects of colonial past as such colonialism influenced berlins relationships with the world both before  and after  the aftereffects of this colonial globality extend beyond formal decolonialisation in the midth century and on into the present they include economic and political inequality and dependency relationship between the global south and north the colonial legacy also still shapes the thoughts and perceptions of many white europeans a striking example of this is the ongoing phenomenon of racism deriving in part from colonial mindsets of previous centuries","it is a very interesting and interactive museum that inspires and educates on the topic of globality globality is something we as a species should strive to achieve but not without doing it with caution since what already is could be altered negatively i think the museum gives great historical depictions of how globality has impacted germany giving the country a strong economy without running into issues that cant be fixed the first room skillfully depicts our tendency to create barriers to protect what we have created making it not fruitful for all impacted by the creation strongly recommend this museum","it is my second time at humboldt forum after visiting another exhibition several weeks earlierthis one is fascinating because of the different style of displaying berlin i can say that i have never seen berlin from another angle maybe i am not that old to know the whole history of germanys capital or i have never been able to get to know berlin bettermost of us know about the unpopular side of history of germany world war ii and its aftermathit has changed germany completely not only the history but also the arts socialite economy and religionthe first room with graffiti has shown the colonial past of germany because of industrialization it needs more raw materials and since the country did not have any resources african countries were its targets and have been conquered by german troops african people were killed and used in the german wars in the th centurywith new resources german science has been greatly improved and its arts cultures and medicinesberlin has now become the german melting pot in which people of different world cultures come and live together it is open to everyonefrom the s century onwards berlin has adapted lots of the worlds culture and it has created various kinds of subcultures eg swing rock  roll hippies punk and hiphop dominating certain timeframes in the past due to that the capital is known for subculture diversity and still attracts people from all over the worldreligion has played a big role not only in berlin history but also in the german one there was lots of state persecution of different religions and laws against themafter world war ii restrictions were lifted so that emigrated people are coming back to germany and new religions are implemented and welcomedthere are also some disadvantages going global such as controlling people through cameras and via media and the cost of living rent included is climbing higher and higher each year due to the high immigration rate versus less living area it has now climbed almost to the range of hamburg bremen and different cities situated in west germanythe capital struggled because of the privatization of public living space fewer apartments and buildings are built due to profit orientation of companiesnevertheless berlin is still a hot and trending city to work and live in but there are still rooms for improvement","the colonial past of germany in the first room of the exhibition is represented by a couple graffities combined with a more detailed picture of an antique site of stone figures the advanced weapons and brutality of their actions against the colonized people is depicted very clear and very graphic in the graffitithroughout the whole exhibition the globality and the intercultural connections is always referred to in one way or another depending on the specific historical time displayed in the exhibition when displaying holocaust survivors and victims personal belongings or the their personal history through their children and grandchildren the global connection and the influences and paths were also displayed and referred toeven on more modern displays the globality and intercultural connections were always referred to by telling their life storys their struggles or their experiencesevent through historical developments and events such as music genres and fashion trends the globality and diversity is displayed much clearer and actually gives the viewer a different perspective that wasnt so clear to think about before this way the globality that actually was always present but never much thought about is displayedthe display that had the most impact on me was the one with all the video cameras and how we actually give our personal information up so willingly but would not want to be filmed or supervised in such an obvious way","the exhibition berlin global shows us how the city is connected to the world through its history social movements culture and people the exposition is divided into seven parts to help us going through various topics such as revolution free space boundaries entertainment war fashion and interconnectionone of the most impressive things presented was the large graffiti presented in the first room on which the artists showed us not only that the oppression of people and nature continues to this day and the confrontation of past discoveries and current but touched on a topic such as the colonial past of germany by looking at the graffiti we can see the world map and ships going on expeditions that led not only to the knowledge of the world but also to the assertion of their power due to their enslavement of other people and seizure of resources the exhibition is worth a visit","berlin global is one of those modern exhibitions that try very hard to be many things at the same time and end up being very little the whole thing is an amalgamation of graffiti artwork a collection of old posters short infovideos about historic events random artistic installations and lots of interactive games there is no clear focus on anything neither in terms of topics covered nor regarding the means by which they are displayed as a result the experience becomes rather confusing there is also a pretty obvious and shallow political angle to it after the second room the message becomes clear the colonial past is evil and modern globalization and diversity exclusively positive if that is the type of thing you are looking for then this is definitely the right place to go if you however expect to actually learn something interesting about the berlins global connections throughout history you will probably leave disappointed  i mean i get it you are very liberal at the humboldt forum   thats fine   but that is no excuse for not having any actual contentto be fair there are a few positives the large mural in the first room is definitely a very nice and thought provoking piece of art about germanys colonial past and the collection of historic election posters is also quite interesting there is also a lot of interactive games unfortunately i was not able to figure out why they are not meaningful in any way more like turn this table and you will see a video for the younger audience that might be entertaining enough in itself i guess but one wonders what these entirely pointless gimmicks are good for as there is definitely no educational benefit to itif that were not enough the exhibition tries to be even more interactive between every room there are two doors   each with a different statement printed above it if you walk through either your armband that was given to you at the entrance will register your choice at the very end there is the possibility to print out your results and see some comparable statistics of what other people have chosen while in theory this could be an interesting concept it falls way short in practice the armband doesnt register properly half of the time and even if they work the questions are somewhat puzzeling you get to choose between statements like my city should be welcoming and my city should take care about its citizens this is not just far to broad to be useful it is also not clear why these things are treated as mutual exclusive when they are in fact not and so this exercise ends up as another pointless gimmickconclusion berlin global clearly tries to be something   i have no idea what to be honest   and ends up being some odd potpourri of half baked ideas and good intentions two stars for artwork and poster collection and for effort i guess","i personally enjoyed seeing berlin global once because i grew up in berlin i was very interested in the event and was able to understand and relate to a lot of it berlin global shows globality very well through things that make berlin what it is we find aspects like the second world war the berlin wall different cultures and the global problems of our world like climate change or social injustice in addition it is conveyed in berlin style through graffiti in the first room for example the colonial past was well expressed in the first room by the graffiti wall from the suffering of the second world war to the postwar period to the multicultural berlin of today everything is included this room  expresses freedom without end and gives you the feeling of berlin","i am usually not a big fan of exhibitions however what quite surprised me was the interactive character of the exhibition i imagine it is more appealing to a lot of people that way the globality in berlin global or more likely the diversity of the exhibition is as one would expect mostly represented through berlins history as someone rather unknowledgeable about cultural differences even to me it felt a lot like the globality was focused quite a lot on the differences between the eastern and western part of berlin in the brochure of the exhibition it says what has been spread from berlin to the world and perhaps i was not paying close enough attention to it as i had to rush through the last part but to me personally i am a bit confused about the purpose of the exhibition is it supposed to show how globality has influenced the city and the citizens or what influence berlin has had on globality or as the brochure said what has been spread to the world from berlin for me the most globality could be seen in the very first room with the big mural which has a bit of a negative feeling to it as a lot of the mural was depicting historical events from a european perspectivei am not very wellversed in artsy matters so it took me some time to understand what many of the depictions were supposed to represent some screen close to the gates to the next room helped me a lot in that regard because i have always had some trouble interpreting a deeper meaning to illustrations while looking at them on my own and i didnt really have someone to discuss it with either an example is the how some former big world leaders decide about how to split territorial rights of specific regions amongst them as if they were a piece of cake after some initial hesitation i thought it to actually be a quite accurate depiction of this very situation of the colonial past on a happier note two parts of the mural depict possible future scenarios on the one hand there are the broken chains being shown in between multiple parts of the mural indicating that the present is still chained and influenced by the colonial past but encouraging humanity to break free from those chains through communication and taking the initiative to change something on the other hand there is the world surrounded by clasping hands a dove potentially symbolizing freedom showing that if humans were working together and being on eyelevel instead of one party looking down on another out of a false sense of superiority real change might possibly be achieved","ive lived in berlin all my life but ive never had the opportunity to visit berlin global  i really regret it because i got a very good overview of berlin and all of its sides which was very enriching for me  i want to go into  different topics in my review  first of all how globality is represented in berlin global and also how the colonial past is represented in room   berlin global tries to represent the world with its different cultures and ethnic groups  the coexistence of people should be portrayed as peacefully as possible  the graffiti show impressions of oppression war and grief that have divided people in the past  especially in the st room you can see this clarification based on the numerous graffiti that are on the walls  the world should be a place for everyone according to the artists  in the rd room you can see the revolutionary movements of the past showing people who fought for peace and stood for solidarity the colonial past still shapes people today it is one of the main reasons why a city like berlin for example is very multicultural to this day  from the graffiti on the walls you can see how people suffered and lived their lives with war and weapons  however they left the hurry that has shaped todays germany  music culture food and much more from other ethnic groups are very present in berlin and belong to the city just like the locals i would recommend this exhibition to everyone including anyone who grew up here  its like a journey through time of berlins history that gives you different insights of all kinds","this exibition gives you the right keys for thinking about berlin problems and colonialism in generalwhile entering the main gate of humbolt forum i was questioning myself was i entering the real subject of discussions for its diversity and inclusivity or a part of a history left behindthe first room where the kind exhibition worker explained us how to use our bracelets greeted us with a satirical note the topics such as colonial hubris divison of africa genocide of the hetero and nama charting human beingsjoined together on the main walls as an art work in a casual environment the message was clear we are all world citizens ideas and experience should be exchanged","the berlin global exhibition takes a look at berlin from a global perspective focussing on art culture history and social matters such as racism and gender it features many interesting historical objects such as paintings photographs protest signs from demonstrations old maps and advertisements and everyday objects of interesting historical figures however as interesting as the selection of topics and objects is i couldnt help but feel like the exhibition paints a generally negative image of globality as exemplified by the first room weltdenken whose dimly lit walls are covered in a sombercoloured mural depicting scenes of violence pollution and chaos from the colonial era the subjects of colonialism and racism appear again and again for example in a  minute film featuring actors of colour born in germany describing their experience with stereotypical portrayals of africans in the nazi era movie industry as well as todays racism in social media and everyday life arguably global successstories such as international trade or the international organisations arent addressed by the exhibition at all a silver lining however is drawn by a room depicting the political and social progress made in different areas such as religious freedom or gender equality and another room i found particularly interesting is mainly focussing on different cultures in berlin and contains a collection of posters advertising concerts by numerous internationally acclaimed artists such as david bowie or the beach boys a hint of positivity was also added in the mural of the first room in which the artists added white doves shattering chains and a bunch of hands reaching out for each other across planet earth which i interpret as expressing the artists hope that the globality of the past constituted by violence and exploitation is replaced by a globality of peace and cooperation furthermore there is an interactive element to the exhibition inasmuch as the visitor is asked to use a digital wristband to answer questions or choose between statements by interacting with the screens or by walking through certain doors an evaluation of the visitors dominating values is printed at the end of the exhibition as creative and refreshing the idea is i cant help but feel that the reductive and often dualistic choices one has to choose between make it questionable whether the end result is meaningful at all all in all i still enjoyed the visit as someone wellversed in history by focussing on cultural and social developments the exhibition brought themes and issues to my mind i wouldnt normally research and thus broadened my horizon i would recommend a visit but not without pleading to not let the somber beginnings of globality namely colonialism and imperialism overshadow the chances of a more interconnected world","while the exhibition was tremendous event a person can visit and learn more about things in depth as it is very informative while the concept that i perceived was that how much changes we have brought into this world in every aspects whether its music culture technology etc i was getting the vibe that being innovative is the best thing and making things as better as possible because at the end hard work pays off and the world will benefit out of it  it also tells you about the history including the era of colonization and the after effects of it and that depicted me that either you have to work hard to get on the top or you become a slave","the focus of this exhibition is clearly set on berlin and the way it evolved throughout the years the development of the metropolis is depicted from various perspectives an undeniable advantage of the exhibition is the intergration of new technologies which makes the visit to berlin global interactive and even more captivating a recurring theme that one can observe in the exhibition is globality  how it impacted berlin and at the same time how berlin influenced the world the whole exhibition is divided into several rooms each of them showcasing a different aspect of the city such as colonial times war entertainment or fashion one exhibition room ie thinking the world presents  the world history with the means of a huge colorful graffitti depiting  colonial times how countries have been intertwined throughout centuries and other crucial historical events the message behind the lively drawings is very saddening though  our world has been always a witness of greed exploitation killing and other atrocities that human race would commitglobal berlin enables its visitors to dive into an interesting at times suprising tale of the worlds history with a string focus on berlin an unforgettable experience enhanced by the new technologies","i have been living near berlin since more than three years but never had a chance to visit this exhibition before it was my first time and it was totally worth it berlin is a city with an unbelievable blend of rich history diversity and serenity a true depiction of such a mix in form of an exhibition is same like fitting an ocean into the cup but berlin global is near to exception in this regard a few hours in this exhibition already shows you amazing glimpses of historic moments fashion music and overall berliner vibe i also liked this graffiti where the colonial past is portrayed in the form of beautiful arts these colorful drawings not only give us a lesson of history but also carry a strong message of freedom within them i would highly recommend this exhibition even if you are not a big fan of exhibitions and museums just like me as this one is different just as the berlin is","for me the global part was actually kind of missing the whole exhibition seemed to me more like berlin in contemporary history until today in my opinion the music and culture section was a bit pointless i mean yes hip hop came up in the s and was a big thing in germany and berlin but where in the world did it not become a trend to me that doesnt seem to be very specialunique therefore id rather recommend the movie bmovie which actually talks about culture and scene in berlin and also focuses on it being one of the places to be during the s and s timeoverall the topics were very interesting and surely berlin did have a big impact on the global world but unfortunately in my opinion fails to thoroughly bring up these impacts maybe its worth a trip if you dont really know a lot about it but history fans will know most of the information already on the other hand the first room which has a big mural is quite cool and makes a lot of connections between colonial history and the postcolonial world bringing up topics like the development of medicine which advanced a lot through human rights violations in the past in retrospective wouldve liked to see more like the first room which left space for a lot of interpretation unlike the rest of the exhibition that seemed a little too superficial to me trying to cover to many aspects of the history","the exibition demonstrates that global challenges do not stop at borders military conflicts migration climate change from uncontrolled growth environmental destruction social injustice human exploitation and limited resources  these problems affect everyone solving them will require overcoming the worlds divisions small details and big pictures the local and the global need to be viewed together global networks should form and ideas and experience should be exchanged we are all world citizensthe walls of the room  weltdenken are coverd in paitings which illustrate the centuries of charting dividing and ruling the world continuesly having effect to this day they cannot simply be erased but we should take initiative and attempt to throw off the chains of the past communication is the leitmotif of this call for liberation  we need to talk to one another","globality is presented through several aspects for which berlin is so famous these aspects are war revolution borders fashion free space interconnection and entertainment they are shortly introduced together in one room through photos taken in berlin and short explanations of their meaning for the city in addition each aspect has its own room which is dedicated to the topic and further discusses its connection to berlin to illustrate the globality of the city different approaches are taken for instance there are shown numerous photos and stories of members of ethnic groups living in berlin vintage posters of international musicians who were performing in the city or comics depicting the ethnic influences on evolution of art and subculture in berlin the exhibitions orientation on globality is also expressed in an attempt to get visitors involved by expressing their opinions through special wristbands the wristbands enable to take part in voting about topics concerning future with regard to globality there are also other interactive elements such as possibility to listen to old music recordings or personal stories of foreigners who have left their home countries and moved to berlinthe graffiti shows events from the colonial times eg conquest of america berlin conference and their impact on people and environment it portrays violent treatment of natives by colonizers and how these actions negatively affected culture prejudices about other races and nature pollution the humboldt brothers are also incorporated in the composition their presence symbolizes science and its advancement which is positive but it also has a negative side because this would be not possible without the support of colonialist whats more the graffiti depicts the symbols of peace and connection which should probably stand for peaceful solving of problems though cooperation and dialogue to conclude its a nice exihibition but i dont have a need to go there again","the exhibition intricately captures the spirit of the capital city berlin showcasing the various facets that the city is endowed with it throws light on the significant events which occurred in the past that in turn shaped the city into what it is today globality is represented via stories graffiti and installations covering topics like fashion free space boundaries entertainment etc these features attempt to depict the interconnection of berlin with the rest of the worldthe exhibition delicately encounters sensitive topics such war gender identity and revolution it is indeed fascinating to have such a wonderful representation of history cultures divisions and interconnections that root from the colonial period there are so many interesting aspects of the exhibition but the ones that caught my eye were the time wheel and the space where you can put on headphones and dance to the retrobeats or so i would say maybe think of something like a silent disco another interesting thing about the exhibition is that it is highly interactive as it requires you to make choices at several instances and you can also present your opinions at certain points by voting which is facilitated by a wrist band provided to you at the beginning the colonial past is depicted in the first room through graffiti murals and installations that describe the significant events that occurred in the past one can derive a clear picture of the devastating effects of wars and slave trade further you also get insights into the revolutions in detail through videos from the colonial time that has today resulted in the unique essence of the cityoverall the exhibition flawlessly displays the rich culture and diversity the city holds i would highly recommend visiting humboldt forum and have this amazing experience","i really like the idea of this exhibition that use the technology the watch and those creative design in every room to let visitors interact with several topics at first i was amazed by the watch and the different languages they use in the system at every entry of a room one choice of two different thoughts about a topic needed to be done which was not just interesting but made people to think about the topics through this exhibition globality and diversity are everywhere in the room thinking of the world huge graffiti was all around the wall showing the history of colonial the progress of technology and its effects and some symbols and words of other countries to express a wish to make the world a home or to make people from wherever to think about our own planet the graffiti of colonial past unabashedly showed both the cruelty of colonization and its contribution to the world puzzle just like other topics it shows the bright side the ambitions and achievable powerful future of the european rulers but also shows the dark side the failed resistance and the treatedasgoods future of the colonized peoplebesides the room thinking of the world what captured my eyes was the room free space and entertainment the former showed the changes regards to culture art and acceptance of cross gender of berlin people the latter was not just about those entertainment revolution but involved the integration of people with different background and how they fighted for their right and the equality this exhibition was truly meaningful and presented the globality and the diversity in berlin","the exhibition is very modern and tries to represent the connection around the world using different topics such as the history art and much moreright at the beginning everyone gets a bracelet that tracks which decision one is taking and that will be analyzed and compared to the other visitors at the end the exhibition displays the development which was influenced by historical events all over the world and by people of different culturesthe exhibition shows the global effect without which berlin probably wouldnt be that multicultural and openminded as it is today there are videos of foreigners and people who seem to be different than others in some peoples eyes taking about how life was like for them being treated differently often with much hate and how it has changed over time this shows how people who were outcasts once became part of the society as society has changed in the past due to many influences and changes in peoples mind this is one example but there are much more illustrations of how globality had a positive impact the exhibition represents how people of different ethnic groups and ages enjoy time together through music or events and creating new styles by combining various cultural influences this impact of mixing different cultures also influenced many other sectors the first room illustrates the colonial past using scenes where people are fighting and discovering new areas but also displaying a mixture of cultures by showing things that are typical for these countries and putting them together we can see blood and destruction but on the other hand there are also a lot of doves and broken chains that initiate a change furthermore this room shows us that the world should stick together and reach for peace seeing that one can also interpret that they want to express that challenges and hard times can be overcome when cultures are combined and creating a better world where people help each otheri really liked the turning table which combines history with modern technology with the thought of connecting people each piece containing a year has to be loaded by putting the hands under the table this is can be easily done when more people are helping by turning the table a year can be chosen to learn more about the events of that particular year which will then be shown on a screen around the table although i usually avoid going to exhibitions i would recommend going to berlin global because it is different compared to other exhibitions","berlin global is a very deep touching and interesting as well as modern exhibition at the humbold forum it was not my first visit and yet new aspects keep catching my eye  it shows how berlin is connected to the world and people from all over the world come together and connect the many different exhibits of the individual artists embody the globality to which the name berlin global draws attention i do not want to reveal too much to let everyone his personal first impression so just a little something as a foretaste to the first room in room  the wall graffiti refers to historical events and symbols from different cultures the entire Â° of the room shows what happened in the colonial past and also who had to suffer from it like how inhabitants trying to defend themselves with wooden spears against metal","berlin is a city located in the heart of europe and it is unavoidable not to be affected by many cultures in berlin global berlins past is represented with various items such as videos pictures there i found information which is not only about berlin i learned how people live their lives differently even in similar locations in different times of the worldin room  the mural graffiti refers to historical events symbols from various cultures the events that the whole world is affected by it shows what was done in the colonial past for example it shows how underdeveloped nations try to fight against guns with their wooden spears it also depicts the effects of colonialism on nature historical characters that have huge effects on todays society are drawn in this graffiti","exhibition berlin globali can recommend with confidence the exhibition berlin global for anyone interested in comprehending the citys and worlds history culture and identity through a new angle the interactive exhibition located in the humboldt forum near alexander platz is easy to reach by bike it took me  mins and because of its interactive approach and innovative storytelling adequate for people of all ages the idea of following your own path through the exhibition by making choices and selecting specific situations is very impressive and something i have never seen before you can clearly see the globality of this exhibition through different work of art and graffities one that really caught my attention was my revolution which covered major revolutionary events in the modern history like the arab spring revolutionsthroughout all rooms of the exhibition the observer is confronted with different topics that animate to question the positive and negative parts of globalization not only specifically in berlin but in the world and if the city is as borderless free and interconnected as it appears at first glance for example there is a large graffiti deals with many different subjects seen in the exhibition from terrible events that shaped europe such as the colonization racism  the realities of wars to early scientific research and the relationship between humans and nature all in all the exhibition as a hole invites the observer to reflect where berlin is now a days and where society is heading","the exhibition has innately depicted several instalments which speaks about the  capital city of germany showcasing the topics of history times of world war struggle of different troops during the time devastating effects of the war developments in the lifestyle culture and many more installations are put together in a manner that they are somewhat interactive and pretty intriguing at the same time for instance the voting system throughout the exhibition was quite appealing one has to choose between two doors with some questions like  i want to help the world and i want to help my community in order to enter a new section  some serious issues like racism and transgender identity had also a special place at this exhibition the section where it had the dj mixer was one of my favourite sections it said about the kind of music berliners are used to listening to   â¨â¨the colonial past is portrayed with the help of different paintings on the walls various topics like exploitation slavery harassment inequality were described through these murals","when entering the exhibition on is greeted with a room where all the walls are covered in a huge graffiti different events and effects of colonialism are shown in different parts of the graffiti the division of countries by longitude and latitude instead of existing cultural realities and the war and destruction that  this devisions lead to the destruction of non european history and works of arts the horrors of slave trade and the justification of discriminatory policies by seintific means it is worth to spend a lot of time in this room there are a lot of noticable detailthe rest of the exhibition feels a little like an exhibition on berlin its history and current state  i was hoping for more detail on the various ways berlin is globally connected these connections were in the exhibition but a little hidden some personal stories  of people comming to or going from berlin as well of a few examples like how our clothes are produced every person visiting the exhibition got a bracelet whit which one could make some decisions during the exhibition ad the end one could compare the personal decisions with that of other visitors a cool idea but sadly there were a lot of technical problems","berlin global attempts to show ways in which the world is connected the exhibition highlights challenges the world faces and that need to be viewed in a global perspective because they affect many people beyond country borders it makes visitors aware of these issues and encourages us to think about them and exchange our thoughts with other people the exhibition succeeds in providing input for such discussions however i do miss more depth in the presentation of some of the different themes but as a general introduction it works really well the exhibition has a high degree of interactivity lots of artwork and information to read if you want the full experience you could easily spend at least two hours herein the first room visitors can observe a large mural depicting scenes of european conquest the painting shows different aspects of the history of this such as the subjugation of land and people the division of these areas among colonial powers and the subsequent exploitation of native populations and areas however the painting also portrays the brothers wilhelm and alexander von humboldt and their shared interest in topics concerning global interconnection and diversity showing appreciation for the uniqueness of all cultures which stands in contrast to the general sentiment of the colonial past where european cultures were viewed as superiorat the beginning of the exhibition you also have the opportunity to receive a chip wristband that you wear throughout your visit this is supposed to provide additional interactivity as well as give you the opportunity to find out more about yourself and the choices you make however in the end this turned out to be more confusing and distracting than useful and did not add much to the experience for me","i see the exhibition berlin global as an excellent opportunity to understand the connection between berlins past and present what i really like about this exhibition is that it does not represent the point of view of only one ethnic or cultural group instead the berlin global exhibition allows you to learn how people from different backgrounds perceive their lives and events in a different way as for the organisational part of the exhibition it includes various ways of communicating the events of the past including texts videos graphics interactive activities and gamesmy first impression of global berlin came from the room called weltdenken it is very beautiful with graffiti on the walls and this modern designed room tells us the story of colonisation i think it is no coincidence that this room is the first one because it shows us clearly that we have to be aware of the events that happened in the past it also shows that germany is linked to the events that happened during the time of colonisation namely exploitation discrimination but also exploration of the world i think one of the points is that people on both sides of the historical events perceive these events differently while the early europeans may have seen colonisation as a key to continued growth the colonised countries experienced a lot of suffering and pain basically i think this play wants to remind us of those events that happened before us so that we dont take for granted what we have now but that we also remember that history has evolved for us in different ways ethnic and cultural diversity is one way of seeing berlin as a global place the people of berlin come from a variety of ethnic cultural and religious backgrounds these differences which at some points in history were seen as a border are now seen as a choice to which every individual is equally entitled as an example i remember a video in which three women are having a very friendly conversation what is specific to this video is that these women believe in three different religions namely christianity islam and judaism although they come from different places they recognise that there is nothing wrong with being different and they also show a desire to learn more about each others culture in addition there were several charts on the wall on topics such as religious practices arts politics etc which show historical trends in a chronological way here we can see many historical events that happened in the past specifically i remember when the first hippie community appeared in  what is interesting is that it shows the interconnection between world events and berlins relationship to them we could also see on the graph when the first hippie communities developed later in germany below you can see some of the pictures i made on these graphs","berlin global is a quite interesting and modern museum it shows how berlin is connected to the world the museum represents globality through many different interactive exhibition pieces we can find there  main topics such as revolution entertainment war fashion boundaries interconnection and free space there is a huge globe in the first room that shows different points connected to each other also there are beautiful graffity all over the walls where we could see how the whole world was presented from the colonialism era till the presentat the doorscorners there were questions that made us make decisions with our bracelets sometimes it was a little bit difficult to choose the right statement personally for me and it made me think and that is good i learned lots about history berlin fashion art it helps me to make sense of the world cross the border feel intertwining the lives of people from different countries by their stories it took more that  hours to see all the beauties of this exhibition and think about globalization art people highly recommend to visit this place","the exhibition was very interesting and informative there were a lot of interactive objects so it wasnt boring at all the first room featured colorful graffiti painted on  walls the first room featured colorful graffiti i spent a long time looking at the walls where there were pictures of warlike people ships weapons maps houses animals and aborigines it was an exhibition on the theme of colonialism the graffiti made me think of problems like looted art pollution and violence against the local population of the colonies i was able to recognize famous figures such as the humboldt brothers elector friedrich wilhelm and christopher columbus who are also connected to the history of colonization i think that the exhibition is called global berlin because it raises important and global themes related to berlin  a megalopolis of global significance  topics that are important for all humanity are presented at the exhibition revolution free space borders entertainment war fashion and interconnectioni really liked the bracelet voting idea i was also fascinated by the time wheel","the globality of the berlin global is represented through  perspectives namely through revolution free space boundaries entertainment war fashion and interconnection each perspective showed how the city has impacted the world and at the same time how the world has impacted this great city  i was imperessed by the graffiti in the first room which depicted different historic events starting with the  with christopher columbus landing on the bahamas which basically was a starting point of the colonization of the new world or depiction of the transportation of the slaves from one of the first german colony in ghana to the new world or division of africa by european powers which resulted in the first genocide of the xxth century  also it is interesting the way the authors of the mural showed how the colonial powers used science and scientists in their pursuit to more power and control","how is globality represented in global berlinglobal berlin shows many different parts of berlins globality it represents globality through many different interactive and traditional exhibition pieces the first room sets the mood for the theme with a giant globe that shows different points connected to each other global berlin is divided into several different sections of various topics and shows the global aspects of each topic for instance the section berlin images shows berlins nightlife history of the s and points out that many musicians from all over the world took part in its glorious time also berlin images notes that breakdance rose in the s on the streets of west and east berlin and therefore shaped berlins society ever since the exhibition pieces are partly interactive by gathering information about the visitors opinion on certain subjects and reporting the answers at the end in comparison to other visitors answers this interactive feature lets the visitor realize how they are influenced by globality in their everyday life and their attitude toward globality the noninteractive exhibition pieces are short documentaries paintings and historical relics about positive aspects of globality in berlin such as diversity innovation and progress but also negative aspects such as discrimination how is the colonial past depicted in room  weltdenkenroom  shows a large mural in graffiti style and displays the different colonial divisions of the world even though it is in a graffiti style the mural was showing collagelike scenes of breaking with the colonial times and standing up against the system of injustice for which colonial times stand these different little stories as part of the mural show for instance a pigeon the forgiveness and freedom flying away with a chain in its beak leaving behind an empty cage the statue of liberty is looking towards the scene while being blindfolded which reminds the observer of lady justice also known as goddess justicia of roman mythology the scene seems like a homage to the american revolution of overcoming the injustice of its colonial past","the berlin global exposition in the humboldt forum puts an emphasis on globality in the city of berlin in fact berlin due to its past but also to its capital status is a very cosmopolite city the city even celebrates diversity every year at an even called the carnival of cultures  the past explains nowadays diversity in berlin with the persecution of people especially during the nazi dictatorship the city now understands the importance of accepting diversity  the same reflection can be seen through colonialism in the first room we can observe a painting on the right side representing the colonial past  we can clearly see an opposition between the right side which is the local people defending its land with shields and more traditional weapons like knives swords and spears only a few of them have guns  however on the left side we have colonialists who are all equipped with guns they are more equipped overall and the battle is therefore unfair from the start they are depicted as nonhuman beings as the look on their eyes is completely empty we can also see a commander holding a map of africa which we know for a fact is part that was probably the most affected by colonialism he is brandishing it as he is claiming the continent  overall the colors chosen by the artist are really dark and pale giving the painting a not so joyful atmosphere a lot of black ink dark purple pink red diversity is also expressed through the art we can observe in berlin the city is known for its cultural diversity in music street art or fashion  the humboldt museum is itself related to globality the humboldt brothers who founded the museum were passionate about interconnections around the world they loved to travel and speaks other languages therefore the museum reflects their attraction towards globality","in the different rooms different topics are presented also the change of renting and housing is shown as well as the change of lifestyle in berlinthere was one interactive screen where it was possible to depict the connection that each individual visitor has to the world also there were some listening features where different people talked about their lives in one corner the whole sexuality and gender topic was present and how this changed over time there was one condom automat the import of rubber made it possible to produce those the exploitation of other cultures has been pushed into the background for this topic for the clothing corner that was more present also the topic of sustainability was present the basic topics are fashion revolution clearance borders amusement war and interconnection each subject is affected by globalization all in all the whole exhibition was more about history of berlin than about globality as its own the entry walls and the wall on the left hand side depict different signs of the colonial past especially slavery it starts with the discovery of america in  and ends with the exploitation of human capitalmy favourite part of the exhibition was the decision making with the bracelets at different corners or doors there were questions the answers werent very precise but it was interesting to see peoples answers the summary of the answers at the end could have been a little bit more creative","quite interesting modern museum established in the classic building already the first room is very impressing as it depicts colonial past of germany especially exciting for people from abroad however it is presented in the very uptodate form with many interactive elements and large images in style of modern art it is worth to advise to plan some time to narrowly analyse the whole mural and make our own interpretation of this the thing i liked the most in this room was the possibility to read about alexander von humboldt as well as about his less famous brother wilhelm and his attitude towards colonialismin other rooms we can learn more about berlin in global context we will not find here many typical museum exhibits  there is many interactive elements there of course we can come upon some older original items like eg stands made from the original old photographs presenting the war time or entertainment in the twenties i personally enjoyed the most the area of the propagandist posters from the beginning of the s what for sure depends on the interests reading them was very surprising for me also a little bit funny and informativepresented historical objects are quite well interacted with modern elements to make it easier for the visitor to see the place of berlin in the global context it allows to better understand the current place of berlin and germany at all in the world perspective because i dont come from germany many issues were new for me and thus very informative i liked the idea to present the history of the globality in berlin and how it influences the present","globality means to be connected united and even working together to make the world a better place even though deep down every individual is different or shares other interests for this to work being open to new things and changes is crucialberlin global shows how berlin is connected to the world it divides globality into  main topics such as revolution free space boundaries entertainment war fashion and even interconnectionberlin global shows deep insights into the past and the process how berlin has transformed to one of the most open cities in the world with people from all over the world calling it their home todayberlin often promotes the feeling of being different or imperfect which implicates perfection and makes it the perfect place the colonial past is described as a dark time in human history although it connected the world and promoted global trade as we know today one may also say it was the beginning of globality","the exhibition turned out to be fun and engaging the interactive components helped me understand the presented information better and to feel in the past the rooms were very big and going through each of them and actively engaging with the content was later a bit exhausting however given unlimited time it was still an enriching experience     the first room was painted with graffiti which looked nice on the first sight but upon closer look it became apparent that the graffiti depicted an overall history of colonial past with the blackandwhite drawings combined with pinkish background colours portraying typical moments and emotions of these periods  greed stealing killing or exploitationberlin global exhibition tried to show the globality of berlin through its culture history and people all the components helped to shape berlin into the state it is nowadays however these components are also what connects people around the worlddefinitely recommend it","my personal impression about the humboldt museum is a good one in my opinion the pieces and artefacts in the museum truly depicts the theme berlin global alexander von humboldt described the world as an ecosystem in which everything is interconnected and i believe this statement is the central idea of globality the first picture attached was the most memorable pictures i took at the exhibition interestingly i did not expect to see a common household item from my home country at the exhibition this artefact although small truly depicts globality to me it brought a sense of belongingness the display of very sentimental objects from all over the world stimulates interaction and promotes a deeper understanding among people of the world i was also impressed about how candid the interviews were from the few i listened to i realized that although people are learning to respect and accept different cultures there are still so many conservatives who are not willingly to accept people for who they arethe mural depicts the role the colonial past played in bringing the world together the bonds between continents date back centuries world wars slavery and other world events played a huge role in the centralization of culturethe world is indeed a global village and humboldt truly depicts how much the world has evolved the role the colonial past plays in globality and learning to accept and respect different cultures","the exhibition made me aware of some perspectives neglected in my surroundings i have constantly felt like an outsider in germany since i was a foreigner subtle things such as friends hanging out in the mauerpark seeing graffiti on the street listening to people talk about the east and the west berlin or the rental price is never rising to make me think about the background behind it and what it relates i have never lived in berlin but i spent six years in frankfurt oder at first i was not expecting myself to be able to comprehend the concept that this exhibition wanted to deliver however many things rang a bell and i started feeling related that was when i realized that i am part of the community as well as presented in the first room thinking the world they reinforced the idea that we are the world and colonialism shaped many thoughts and actions we have now the greed of human beings in history tells us the consequence and the price it came along my country taiwan was colonized by several nations before and now i am living in germany where it inhabited other places but now people worldwide gather and live in this community and share the same territory however the boundaries created in the past still exist nowadays also what i like about the exhibition is that they cover different angles toward the big picture it can be that you are listening to someone elses story but the next place you arrive you are listening to your own the exhibition emphasizes the disturbance of cultures humanities environment interaction etc that resulted from the colonial past regarding the option of collecting our thoughts throughout the exhibition my result showed me that my primary value lies in security i feel like a foreigner in germany and those boundaries often exclude me however if i return to taiwan and think about this question again i may say that the limits make me feel safe this exhibition allows me to think from a different point of view it encouraged me to learn from the past and make better decisions for the future","two weeks ago i visited the berlin global exhibition at the humboldt forum from my point of view globality was explained in a very visual way and represented as a combination of all aspects of the worldwide life and historial events we learned the most important things that normally people see as a characteristic of the city of berlin as can be entertainment free spaces war interconnection and why are these its characteristics from its historical backgroundit is a huge exposition but i think it is worth to talk about the first room where we could see how the whole world was represented through graffiti all over the walls from the colonialism era until the present there we could see representations of different economic cultural and personal ties between cities and continents such as the linguistic diversity cultural hierarchies education interaction and interconnections between nature and culture wars pollution issues and many more at the end i think that one of the aims of this room is to make us aware of how taking responsibility as a world citizen global networks respect for other cultures and diversity awareness and education can help to avoid divisions to tackle the challenges of a global present and future to discover new perspectives on the world and to break the chains of the past in order to evolve to a better and liberated future","hows globality represented in berlin globalin the exhibition there are several rooms that represent the globality of berlin in a unique way each room tells its own story and reflects the specificity of the city in total the space is divided into  thematic complexes that represent globality revolution free space boundaries entertainment war fashion and interconnection every room shows how berlin has affected the world in the past and now also in the present personally room entertainment impressed most berlins entertainment culture has always thrived on communicating with the world music and dance theatre and cinema draw on a wide variety of influences from tango to techno from swing to hiphop berlins dancefloors play musical styles from all over the world hows the colonial past depicted in room  weltdenken  first the graffiti deals with the european journeys of exploration and conquest around  sent by european rulers seafarers claimed possession of regions they reached enslavement of millions of people and global trade in raw materials boosted the economies of europe and north america further wilhelm and alexander von humboldt are seen on the mural both were interested in global topics throughout their lives wilhelm studied more than seventy languages whereas alexander loved to travel finally the grafitti shows how the german empire began claiming colonies in africa asia and the pacific in th century cultural treasures and everyday objects from the colonies landed in european museums often questionable means","last month i attended exhibition berlin global in humboldt forum which was dedicated to the diversity and differences within the city in many spheres eg cultural sexual etc i was indeed impressed by this exhibition as i usually do not expect much of such cultural events mainly because normally they contain overwhelmingly much theoretical information that is hard to digest in a couple of hourshowever berlin global is a completely different case right from the beginning there were a lot of different installations that were interesting to explore i was especially impressed by the scale of this berlins diversity and globality  it feels in everything starting from the obvious thing  the wall built to divide people and separate them from each other and moving on to gender differences and cultural diversity  all these represent diverse network world existing in berlini was fascinating to explore how people protested against inequality against racial prejudice  and all that happened in one german city at this time you can fully understand why people call berlin a global city  here all is mixed together people from many countries with different attitudes toward the life in general  and everyone feels comfortableparticularly interesting was to understand that this diversity and globality is not a recent trend on the contrary berlin used to be brutal and free city for a long time in the room  weltdenken the large geometrical black figure with different white lines can be seen which from my point of view represents different footprints left from people all around the worldbelow i am including several photos that i like the most  all of them highlight the globality of berlin it is traceable in different ways in each installationoverall i am extremely satisfied with the excursion i understood the capital of germany deeper and i can only recommend visiting berlin global","berlin global combines modernity and history in its different halls on one hand you learn about historical events around the globe which gives the globality the exhibition wishes to convey on its visitors and on the other hand it has interactive areas where the visitor needs to make a decision which sometimes could be an ethical or personal dilemmain one of the rooms an aesthetically pleasing mural is depicting the colonial past in different parts of the world such as africa whilst being mixed with different historical events in an artistic fashion thus combining the problems of the world in the past in a way that we can relate to in this day and ageall in all a great experience and would definitely recommend a visit","berlin global feels very modern it combines historic information and stories with modern art and design plus interactive features the interation comes from decision you can make on your own as well as interactive elements such as the wheel that requires about  people to start a video sequence it triggers interaction between visitors and people who are normally strangers who would not have interacted otherwise i think it is definitely suitable for school classes and seminar groups education price is free its educational and fun although it covers some of the darktest parts of history from my perspective it makes sense to attract normal people first by art or eyecatcher and confront them step by step with the historic stories and elements overall the visit has been an exiting trip and i recommend people to attend this exibition at the heart of berlin"]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>X<\/th>\n
