## Welcome to My GitHub Pages and Bookdown

On my journey I learned what the difference between Github and Git is. Learned a little bit Git from the terminal with Datacamp and how to integrate Git into RStudio. Combining several R markdown chapters into a bookdown is the overall goal. 


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/MarcoKuehne/marcokuehne.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files. Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

This is a minimal example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). Please see the page "Get Started" at https://bookdown.org/home/about/ for how to compile this example.

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/MarcoKuehne/marcokuehne.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

# Git Notes Book Routine

Github Pages displays Book from doc folder. Compile "gitbook" in RStudio which updates material in doc folder. Only need to push new doc folder to github.
